Axiom is a development control plane for keeping software intent,
architecture, implementation, validation, and operational evidence connected
across human and AI work.

## Why Axiom?

- **Intent gets lost.** Specifications preserve outcomes, constraints, and
  acceptance criteria before implementation.
- **Context fragments.** A Project can relate independent repositories without
  treating any one repository as the whole project.
- **Decisions drift from code.** Plans and architecture decisions give humans
  and agents durable references.
- **Completion claims lack proof.** Validation and Evidence make results
  inspectable and reproducible.

Spec-Driven Development connects the reason for a change to its implementation
and acceptance evidence.

## How Axiom works

```mermaid

    I["Intent"] --> S["Specification"]
    S --> P["Decisions<br/>and Plan"]
    P --> X["Implementation"]
    X --> V["Validation<br/>and Review"]
    V --> E["Evidence<br/>and Reconciliation"]
    E -. informs next intent .-> I
```

Implementation proceeds through bounded Executions. Human approval gates
material choices. Evidence supports review and acceptance without replacing
human judgment.

## Project status

Axiom is under active development. This repository currently provides:

- a Codex-first harness with policies, skills, templates, and deterministic
  validation;
- a tested Go implementation of Project rules, portable and machine-local
  state, Codex Runtime installation, GitHub Work Items, and a bounded persistent
  Lingo workflow;
- canonical completion and provenance contracts, bounded detail artifacts, and
  fail-closed local publication and recovery foundations;
- versioned Specifications, architecture decisions, and implementation
  Evidence.

Current limitations include one supported Runtime (Codex), one Work Item
provider (GitHub Issues), and a sequential single-agent workflow. The
[roadmap](docs/product/roadmap.md) describes direction. The
[Specifications index](docs/specifications/README.md) owns detailed scope,
approval, implementation, and acceptance state.

## Explore Axiom

Requirements: Git, Bash, standard POSIX utilities, and Go 1.26 or later. The
first Go command may download the dependency pinned in `go.mod`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rgomids/axiom.git
cd axiom
./scripts/install-axiom.sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
lingo version
lingo first-run
lingo runtime codex install
./scripts/validate-repository.sh .
go test ./...
```

The installer never edits shell profiles. Use the
[Getting Started guide](docs/development/getting-started.md) for setup and the
[command reference](docs/commands.md) for validation, build, archive, and
dogfooding workflows.

## Core concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| [Project](docs/decisions/0001-project-is-not-repository.md) | A logical project boundary, distinct from a Repository, that may associate multiple independent repositories. |
| [Specification](docs/specifications/README.md) | Desired behavior, constraints, non-goals, and acceptance evidence. |
| [Architecture / ADR](docs/decisions/README.md) | System boundaries and durable decisions with rationale and trade-offs. |
| [Execution](docs/architecture/conceptual-model.md#execution-and-proof) | A bounded attempt under known intent and approvals. |
| [Evidence](docs/architecture/conceptual-model.md#execution-and-proof) | An inspectable observation supporting a claim, such as a test, command result, diff, or review. |
| [Authority](docs/product/constitution.md) | Explicit permission and approval boundaries; a proposal does not grant authority. |
| [Agent / Runtime](docs/architecture/conceptual-model.md#actors-and-external-boundaries) | An Agent participates in work; a Runtime supplies its execution environment and capabilities. |
| [Lingo](docs/decisions/0003-lingo-as-axiom-local-control-plane.md) | Axiom's local executable control plane. |

## Architecture

Axiom separates product intent and domain rules from execution tools and
external providers. Lingo conducts local workflows while Runtime and Provider
adapters remain at the boundary.

[Notion discovery](https://app.notion.com/p/3b4e01f22626810791b4f9d016ab5979)
provides product discovery and research context. Versioned repository artifacts
own technical contracts, decisions, and implementation evidence. Discovery does
not imply approval.
