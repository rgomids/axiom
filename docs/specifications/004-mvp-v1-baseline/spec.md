# Specification 004 — Usable MVP v1 Baseline

## Status and authority

**Approved — human approval recorded on 2026-09-20.**

**Issue #94 amendment: Approved, and S6 T26–T29 implementation explicitly authorized on 2026-09-24. Technical implementation is recorded at `56beb4fc310894ff8de128f52c6a96d22711bec8`; human acceptance is not inferred.**

**S7 (T16–T22): explicitly authorized on 2026-09-25. Technical implementation is recorded at `11f2b7decbe4ddef428d4cb3b7e962680100e1db` and `408a2b51f20e797744f9f6ba6eaa00e0061582f9` with [S7 Evidence](evidence-s7.md); T22 Ubuntu native rows remain unexecuted; human acceptance is not inferred.**

**Issue #97 S8 amendment: Proposed for human review on 2026-09-26. It adds
multi-runtime Agent Planning and parent/child Execution Graph behavior before the
release-candidate slice. This proposal does not amend the approved baseline,
accept ADR-0009, approve the amended Plan/Tasks, or authorize implementation.**

Tracked by [#62](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/62) under the
[MVP tracker #15](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/15). Human approval of
this Specification was recorded on 2026-09-20. Approval fixes the MVP behavioral
baseline but does not authorize Tasks, implementation, release, migration, or
external Provider mutation. Because of HD-3, Plan authorization remains blocked
until Specification 002 and the affected security/architecture contracts are
reconciled and approved. The authorized reconciliation change records
[ADR-0005](../../decisions/0005-bounded-local-filesystem-threat-model.md) for HD-3
and [ADR-0006](../../decisions/0006-machine-local-detail-artifacts.md) for HD-2.
Their acceptance follows directly from the already approved human decisions and
does not authorize Plan, Tasks, or implementation.

The E2E Codex POC was explicitly accepted on 2026-09-20 and is historical
Evidence for this Specification. Its experimental commands, formats, storage
choices, and adapters become MVP contracts only where this Specification or an
existing accepted decision says so.

The approved Issue #94 amendment reconciles the delivered S4/S5 baseline with a
durable Work Item lifecycle contract. It does not rewrite S4/S5 history, authorize
implementation, advance S6+, or infer human acceptance from review, merge, CI,
Issue closure, or Provider state.

Normative terms `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY` follow the
[Axiom Constitution](../../product/constitution.md).

## Source baseline

This draft reconciles:

- MVP outcome and delivery boundary in #15;
- guided Project setup in #54;
- Intent-driven Work Item creation in #55;
- Provider-visible workflow projection in #56;
- Runtime skill selectors in #57;
- completion output and detailed artifacts in #63;
- generated-text provenance in #64;
- persistence, recovery, compatibility, and migrations in #66;
- installation, upgrade, and onboarding in #67;
- clean-environment release-candidate acceptance in #68;
- accepted Specifications 002 and 003, their clarifications, Plans, and Evidence;
- ADR-0001 through ADR-0004, the conceptual model, Provider boundaries, product
  roadmap, and Constitution.
- delivered S4/S5 implementation and Evidence in PRs #91 and #93;
- Issue #94's approved durable Work Item lifecycle and metadata-governance amendment.
- Issue #97's recorded product-scope decision for multi-runtime Agent Planning and
  multi-agent execution; repository contracts remain proposed until human review.

## Reconciliation findings

### Already decided

- POC acceptance is historical Evidence, not MVP implementation authority.
- Axiom/Lingo, Project/Repository, Runtime/domain, Provider/Transport,
  Integration/MCP, portable/local, authority, and human-acceptance boundaries are
  already accepted and are preserved below.
- The delivered S1–S7 path is Codex + Lingo + GitHub Issues + one sequential
  workflow. Issue #97 explicitly adds a bounded multi-runtime Execution Graph to
  the MVP after that historical baseline and before release-candidate acceptance.
- Project mutation, Provider mutation, optional Git effects, technical validation,
  and human acceptance are separate outcomes/authority gates.
- Unknown or invalid persisted state fails closed; it is never treated as absent
  or permission to overwrite.

### Human decisions recorded on 2026-09-20

Human review of PR #69 records the following directions:

- **HD-1:** use published checksummed binaries for macOS/Linux, retaining source
  installation for contributors. The authorized Plan/release contract MUST declare
  the exact supported OS/architecture matrix before distribution.
- **HD-2:** keep detailed artifacts durable and machine-local while required by
  workflow/Evidence, with explicit safe cleanup. They are not portable Project
  content. An ADR MUST define their final ownership/lifecycle and the relationship
  between Execution and any pre-Execution correlation identity.
- **HD-3:** use a bounded local filesystem threat model that preserves authorized
  target confinement, supported path/link protection, process concurrency,
  deterministic fault stages, fail-closed uncertainty, guided recovery, and
  protection against partial/invalid canonical state. Malicious same-UID arbitrary
  interleavings and physical power-loss/media-durability guarantees are excluded.
  Specification 002 plus affected security/architecture contracts MUST be
  reconciled before any Plan for Specification 004.
- **HD-4:** use clean v1 installation as the officially supported compatibility
  baseline. Historical POC state is detected and preserved with actionable
  backup/export/reconfigure behavior when applicable; no in-place POC migration
  commitment exists without a later explicit compatibility decision and Evidence.

### Apparent conflicts resolved without changing accepted decisions

- Specification 002 allows a portable-valid Project with no Provider; #54 asks
  setup to collect a Work Item Provider. This draft keeps Provider optional for
  portable validity but requires a supported Work Item capability before the MVP
  Work Item workflow can run.
- #56 requests Provider-visible stages while local state remains authoritative.
  This draft treats Provider metadata as an idempotent projection, not workflow
  ownership.
- #57 shows illustrative command-like skill arguments, while the accepted POC
  proves only the current Codex standalone skill contract. This draft specifies
  selector semantics and defers exact host syntax to validated planning/Evidence.
- #64 applies provenance to Axiom-authored text but forbids claiming transported
  user content. This draft uses one central provenance envelope and requires
  renderers to distinguish Axiom framing from unchanged user text.

No approved Specification or ADR is superseded merely by this draft. The
recorded HD-3 decision requires Specification 002 and the affected security and
architecture contracts to be reconciled before Plan authorization. HD-4 establishes
clean v1 as the compatibility baseline; any future in-place historical migration
requires a separate explicit compatibility decision before implementation.

### Issue #94 amendment — durable Work Item lifecycle anchor

The Work Item is the durable operational anchor that a human can inspect across
machines and after loss of ordinary local availability. It is not a replacement
for either authoritative layer:

```text
Repository artifacts = versioned technical source of truth
Local Execution/workflow state = canonical workflow truth
Provider Work Item = authorized durable projection and recovery signal
```

The amendment introduces a provider-neutral `WorkItemLifecycleStage` projection:

```text
intake
-> specifying
-> specified
-> planning
-> planned
-> implementing
-> implemented
-> reviewing
-> reviewed
-> accepted
```

This lifecycle stage is a deterministic, read-only projection of S4's canonical
Execution gate, its revisioned transition facts, and the explicit human decisions
listed below. It is not persisted or transitioned independently. The only workflow
state machine remains `intake -> specification -> clarification -> plan -> tasks ->
implementation -> review -> evidence -> reconciliation -> completion` under the
existing Execution revision and lineage.

| Canonical local condition | Additional required fact | Derived lifecycle stage |
|---|---|---|
| current gate `intake` | none beyond valid Execution scope | `intake` |
| current gate `specification` or `clarification` | none beyond valid prior gate history | `specifying` |
| current gate `plan` | Specification/Decision references and all required Specification decisions exist; planning authority is not yet recorded | `specified` |
| current gate `plan` with planning authority, or current gate `tasks` | revisioned explicit planning authority; `tasks` also requires the prior Plan transition/reference | `planning` |
| current gate `implementation` without implementation authority | approved Plan/Tasks references and validation plus required human Plan/Tasks approval | `planned` |
| current gate `implementation` with implementation authority | revisioned exact implementation scope and explicit implementation authority | `implementing` |
| current gate `review` before review starts | implementation result and applicable deterministic validation/Evidence references | `implemented` |
| current gate `review` after review starts, or current gate `evidence` or `reconciliation` | revisioned review-start fact; later gates also require the preceding review/Evidence transition facts | `reviewing` |
| current gate `completion` without explicit human acceptance | completed review, resolved or explicitly decided blocking findings, Evidence, and reconciliation references | `reviewed` |
| terminally completed `completion` gate with explicit human acceptance | revisioned human decision identifying the bounded accepted outcome | `accepted` |

Absence of a start/authority fact at the three intentional boundaries above
(`plan`, `implementation`, or `review`) keeps the derived stage at `specified`,
`planned`, or `implemented`; it does not invent a transition. Any other missing,
stale, contradictory, out-of-order, or scope-mismatched prerequisite makes the
derivation `recovery_required`. It MUST NOT select a best-effort stage, mutate the
Execution, or prepare Provider effects.

For GitHub, the exact adapter projection is:

```text
axiom:stage:intake
axiom:stage:specifying
axiom:stage:specified
axiom:stage:planning
axiom:stage:planned
axiom:stage:implementing
axiom:stage:implemented
axiom:stage:reviewing
axiom:stage:reviewed
axiom:stage:accepted
```

A successfully managed GitHub Work Item MUST expose exactly one marker from that
closed set. Zero, multiple, unknown, or contradictory `axiom:stage:*` observations
are projection drift and MUST fail closed for Provider reconciliation. They do not
advance, rewind, or veto an otherwise valid canonical local gate transition.

Orthogonal conditions use zero or more separate provider-neutral flags. The
GitHub adapter maps the MVP set exactly to:

```text
axiom:blocked
axiom:needs-decision
axiom:needs-approval
axiom:recovery-required
```

Flags MUST NOT multiply or rename lifecycle stages. Provider flag mutation does
not create the corresponding local fact; it is only a signal to inspect and
reconcile.

A valid local `blocked` condition remains orthogonal to lifecycle derivation. For
example, an `implementation` gate with valid implementation authority still
derives `implementing` while `blocked` is true and projects both
`axiom:stage:implementing` and `axiom:blocked`. The blocker does not make the
Execution inconsistent, change its derived stage, or produce
`recovery_required`.

Canonical gate transitions remain the explicit local operations. Each transition
MUST validate the current gate, expected Execution revision, required artifacts and
decisions, applicable authority, blockers, and next gate before committing. The
lifecycle projection is recomputed only from the resulting valid local snapshot.
When an applicable blocker prevents the next transition, the operation MUST deny
the transition before mutation, keep the canonical gate unchanged, infer no new
authority, and continue deriving the lifecycle stage and independent `blocked`
condition from the current valid snapshot. Such a denial becomes
`recovery_required` only when the underlying facts are stale, incompatible,
contradictory, unknown, insufficient, out of order, scope-mismatched, or otherwise
do not identify one valid local truth.
Merge, green CI, PR approval, Issue closure, Project status, or Provider labels
MUST NOT create any local fact or satisfy human acceptance.

`reviewed` means the canonical `review`, `evidence`, and `reconciliation` work has
passed and the Execution has reached `completion`; merely entering `review`,
producing Evidence, or obtaining technical/Provider approval is insufficient.
`completion` remains the detailed canonical gate and terminal result boundary.
`accepted` is projected only after that gate is terminally completed and the
bounded outcome has a separate explicit human acceptance decision.

Material changes in the derived lifecycle stage MAY project one bounded idempotent
operational comment. Such a comment contains only a transition/outcome summary, stable
references to Specification/Plan/Tasks/PR/Evidence or other artifacts, and the
next action or blocker. Dense documents, raw logs, chat, unrestricted reasoning,
and copied Evidence do not belong in Provider comments.

Recovery inspection combines Provider stage/flags and bounded transition history
with Repository artifacts and available local records. It may return only:

- current local truth plus a projection-reconciliation preview;
- a validated ADR-0007 recovery plan for an identified prior/new local generation,
  requiring fresh exact authority before mutation; or
- `recovery_required` with the observed contradiction/insufficiency and the human
  decision needed.

Provider and Repository evidence alone MUST NOT silently create an Execution,
select a lifecycle stage, replay a gate transition, create a required local fact,
or grant implementation/acceptance authority.

A Project MAY declare a bounded metadata policy for Work Item and Pull Request
operations. The domain expresses required/default metadata intentions and required
capabilities; provider adapters resolve concrete fields and effects. For GitHub,
the adapter may resolve labels, assignee, milestone, supported Project/status,
and Pull Request labels/assignee/review metadata. Axiom asks the user only for a
required value that remains unresolved after deterministic Project policy and
operation-context resolution. Arbitrary custom fields, a generic workflow engine,
and broad GitHub Projects automation remain outside the MVP.

The MVP intention set is closed to `classification`, `owner`, `delivery_target`,
`tracking_state`, and Pull Request `reviewers`. It uses Specification 002's existing
`policies` document references; it adds no field to the closed `schemaVersion: 1`
manifest. The referenced Work Item metadata policy has its own strict version and
closed schema; unsupported versions fail without migration. Lifecycle stage/flags
remain owned by workflow projection and are not metadata-policy inputs. Provider
observations, identity bindings, credentials, concrete field names, and effect
ledgers remain machine-local or adapter-owned rather than portable domain values.

## Intake

### Problem

The accepted POC proves one local value path, but another developer still needs
project-history knowledge to configure a Project, capture Intent, understand
workflow progress, interpret completion, diagnose failures, identify generated
content, recover state, and upgrade safely. Current behavior is useful Evidence,
not a stable v1 user contract.

### Desired outcome

A developer in a clean supported environment can install Axiom, discover Lingo
and the supported Runtime integration, intentionally configure a Project, create
or select a Work Item, run the bounded Axiom workflow, inspect Evidence, recover
truthfully from supported failures, upgrade through the supported path, and reach
a concise completion result ready for explicit human acceptance.

### Primary actors

- developer configuring and operating a local Axiom Project;
- reviewer deciding Specification, release-candidate, and final MVP acceptance;
- Runtime adapter invoking thin skills;
- Work Item Provider adapter projecting authorized workflow state.

### Constraints

- local-first operation;
- Codex remains the delivered Runtime path through S7; S8 acceptance requires at
  least two real operator-authorized Runtime paths without making either Runtime
  a domain owner or silently broadening the allowlist;
- GitHub Issues is the first supported Work Item Provider adapter, without
  making GitHub a domain requirement;
- macOS and Linux are the selected release OS boundary; the authorized
  Plan/release contract MUST declare the exact supported OS/architecture
  combinations before distribution;
- deterministic application/domain contracts remain usable without model
  judgment where interpretation or generation is not required;
- external mutation, migration, and destructive recovery require explicit
  authority appropriate to their effects.

## Non-goals

The following exclusions consolidate the existing MVP tracker and related-issue
boundaries. They constrain the MVP; they do not establish new behavior or relax
requirements inside the supported local contract:

- mandatory support for multiple external Providers;
- an arbitrary Runtime plugin ecosystem or universal model broker;
- unlimited autonomous Agent Planning or child spawning;
- distributed execution across multiple user machines;
- a cloud control plane;
- multi-tenancy;
- remote collaboration or synchronization;
- distributed persistence or remote locking;
- automatic updating;
- support for every package manager;
- Windows support for the MVP;
- signing, notarization, cryptographic provenance, attestation, or equivalent
  release trust mechanisms unless a future specific decision authorizes them;
  the informational provenance contract below remains required;
- production-grade durability beyond the explicitly supported local MVP contract;
- storing raw chat history as Evidence;
- making detailed artifacts part of portable Project intent;
- general backwards-compatibility guarantees across arbitrary historical
  versions.

## Preserved architectural boundaries

The MVP MUST preserve:

- `Axiom != Lingo`: Axiom owns product/domain/policies/contracts; Lingo executes
  or coordinates them locally;
- `Project != Repository`: one Project may associate multiple independent
  Repositories and no caller CWD becomes Project identity;
- `Role != Model`;
- `Execution != Agent`;
- `Provider != Transport`;
- `Integration != MCP`;
- `Skill != workflow source of truth`;
- `Evidence != raw chat history`;
- portable Project intent is distinct from machine-local state;
- `Runtime skill -> Lingo/application -> Axiom contracts`;
- Provider projection is reconcilable output; local validated workflow state
  remains authoritative for execution;
- user authority, green checks, technical review, merge, Provider closure, and
  human acceptance remain distinct states.

Runtime skills MUST remain thin entrypoints. They MUST NOT duplicate domain,
workflow, output, provenance, authority, persistence, or recovery rules.

## Supported MVP boundary

The delivered S1–S7 baseline supports one local, sequential delivery workflow
through Codex and Lingo. S8 extends that baseline with one bounded parent
Execution whose validated DAG coordinates child Executions across at least two
operator-authorized Runtime paths. Sequential Executions remain valid one-node
graphs and retain their existing identities and history. GitHub Issues remains
the first Work Item Provider adapter. A
Project MAY remain portable-valid without a configured Work Item Provider, but
the supported Work Item journey MUST stop with an actionable missing-capability
result until a supported Provider is explicitly configured.

The supported detailed Execution gates remain:

```text
intake -> specification -> clarification -> plan -> tasks
-> implementation -> review -> evidence -> reconciliation -> completion
```

Clarification MAY be satisfied without a separate artifact when no material
question exists, but its gate result remains observable. Completion requires
all applicable technical gates plus explicit authority for any external
mutation. The Work Item lifecycle projection defined by the Issue #94 amendment
does not replace or advance these gates. Final MVP acceptance remains a separate
human decision.

## User journeys

### J1 — Clean installation and first run

From a clean supported environment, the developer follows published instructions,
installs a traceable Axiom build, discovers `lingo`, installs/verifies the Codex
integration, and receives first-run guidance into explicit Project setup. No
repository CWD, shell-profile mutation, existing maintainer state, or undocumented
credential setup is assumed.

### J2 — Intentional Project setup

The developer starts setup with complete arguments or a guided interview. Axiom
collects Project name/slug, Repository associations, machine-local working-copy
paths, and the Work Item Provider declaration needed by the intended workflow.
It shows portable intent separately from local bindings, validates a complete
proposal, and requires confirmation before publication.

### J3 — Intent-driven Work Item

The developer supplies an Intent. Axiom reuses supplied facts, asks only for
material missing information, and prepares a structured draft covering problem,
outcome, context, scope, constraints, non-goals, and acceptance expectations.
The complete draft is shown before any Provider mutation. Cancellation or denied
authority leaves Provider state unchanged.

### J4 — Visible workflow

The developer starts or resumes the bounded workflow. Local state records the
truthful current Execution gate and provider-neutral Work Item lifecycle stage.
With explicit Provider authority, the GitHub Issue shows exactly one canonical
Axiom lifecycle-stage marker, zero or more orthogonal auxiliary flags, and bounded
transition comments referencing relevant artifacts/Evidence. Failed, invalid,
skipped, contradictory, or interrupted transitions do not advance local truth or
project a later stage as complete.

### J5 — Argument-driven Runtime invocation

A fully specified Runtime invocation supplies Project, Repository, and Work Item
selectors directly and completes without an avoidable question. A partial
invocation asks only for missing or ambiguous values. Unknown or conflicting
arguments produce validation failure rather than silent fallback.

### J6 — Concise completion and details

Every relevant CLI or Runtime operation ends with the same semantic completion
result. The primary summary is short and scannable. When diagnostics, context,
or Evidence exceed that summary, Axiom materializes a Markdown detail artifact
and returns a stable reference to it.

### J7 — Failure, recovery, and retry

The developer can distinguish invalid input, denied authority, interrupted or
partial work, retryable external failure, incompatible state, and local storage
failure. Axiom preserves the last known authoritative state, reports confirmed
external effects, and provides the next safe action. Ambiguous recovery never
claims rollback or deletes unknown content.

### J8 — Supported upgrade

The developer inspects the installed version, follows the documented supported
upgrade path, previews any state migration and backup effects, authorizes mutation,
and verifies the resulting schemas and Runtime integration. Unsupported downgrade,
newer schema, or missing migration path fails before destructive mutation.

### J9 — Multi-runtime planned execution

Given one approved Plan and explicit operator configuration, the Agent Planner
proposes a bounded parent/child Execution Graph from required capabilities,
dependencies, scopes, authority and budgets. The operator reviews material graph,
Runtime/Model Profile and authority decisions. Independent children run in
parallel only when their declared dependencies and repository-isolation rules
permit. Children coordinate through bounded structured questions, contracts,
blockers, artifact publications and results. A dedicated Integration/Reconciliation
Execution integrates isolated results, validates the combined state, and returns
truthful partial or terminal Evidence to the parent. At least two real authorized
Runtime paths participate in the acceptance journey.

### J10 — Release-candidate acceptance

A reviewer executes the complete journey in an isolated clean environment using
an identified release candidate. The run exercises CLI and Runtime entrypoints,
Provider projection, output/provenance, representative failure/recovery, supported
upgrade, Evidence, and documentation. Automated success prepares but never makes
the final human acceptance decision.

## Functional requirements

### Project setup

- **FR-001 Explicit selection:** Project setup MUST NOT infer that CWD is the
  Project or Repository. Logical selectors and explicit paths are inputs, never
  ambient identity.
- **FR-002 Guided completeness:** setup MUST ask only for missing required or
  materially ambiguous inputs and MUST support non-interactive complete input.
- **FR-003 Portable/local separation:** Project identity, Repository keys, and
  Provider declarations belong to portable intent; absolute working-copy paths,
  credentials, observations, and executable locations remain machine-local.
- **FR-004 Review before publication:** Axiom MUST show a safe normalized summary
  of portable and local changes and require exact mutation authority before write.
- **FR-005 Multi-repository:** the flow MUST accept multiple independent
  Repository associations without common paths, Providers, or submodules.
- **FR-006 Provider capability:** the intended Work Item workflow MUST identify a
  supported Provider/capability explicitly. Unsupported Providers MUST remain
  explicit and MUST NOT be silently mapped to GitHub.
- **FR-007 Reexecution:** equivalent setup is deterministic and idempotent;
  conflicting identity, slug, source, binding, or state is explicit.

### Work Item capture

- **FR-008 Intent first:** Work Item creation MUST begin from supplied Intent,
  not require a prewritten Provider title/body.
- **FR-009 Bounded interview:** questions MUST be limited to missing information
  that changes the problem, outcome, context, scope, constraints, non-goals, or
  acceptance expectations.
- **FR-010 Structured draft:** Axiom-authored drafts MUST preserve those sections
  in a Provider-appropriate representation suitable as Specification input.
- **FR-011 Mutation gate:** Provider create/update MUST occur only after the
  complete draft is shown and explicit external-mutation authority is granted.
- **FR-012 Neutral application boundary:** Provider-specific formatting and
  transport remain adapters; the application behavior does not depend on GitHub.

### Workflow visibility

- **FR-013 Local truth:** validated local workflow state is the execution source
  of truth; Provider state is an authorized, idempotent, reconcilable projection.
- **FR-014 Current-stage marker:** the supported GitHub adapter MUST expose exactly
  one canonical current Axiom lifecycle-stage marker from the Issue #94 closed
  namespace. The domain value remains Provider-neutral.
- **FR-015 Transition comment:** a material transition comment MUST contain stage,
  outcome, relevant references, provenance, and next action when applicable.
- **FR-016 Truthful failure:** failed, denied, interrupted, or partial transitions
  MUST NOT present a later stage or external completion as successful.
- **FR-017 Reconciliation:** replay/reconciliation MUST avoid duplicate markers
  and semantically duplicate comments while preserving confirmed Provider effects.
- **FR-038 Durable Work Item anchor:** a managed Work Item MUST expose a bounded
  durable lifecycle projection that connects the current stage to stable
  Specification, Plan/Tasks, Pull Request, Evidence, blocker, and next-action
  references without copying dense artifacts.
- **FR-039 Lifecycle stage:** the closed provider-neutral
  `WorkItemLifecycleStage` MUST be derived deterministically from canonical
  Execution gate/history plus the explicit local facts defined by this amendment;
  it MUST NOT be independently persisted or transitioned. GitHub MUST map the
  derived value to the exact `axiom:stage:*` set and treat zero, multiple, unknown,
  or contradictory markers as projection drift.
- **FR-040 Gate projection:** every canonical gate transition MUST retain S4's
  exact current gate/revision, prerequisite, reference, blocker, and authority
  checks. Lifecycle derivation from the resulting snapshot MUST either return the
  unique mapped stage or `recovery_required`; it MUST NOT mutate canonical truth.
- **FR-041 Auxiliary flags:** blocked, decision, approval, and recovery conditions
  MUST remain orthogonal to lifecycle stage. Provider markers MUST NOT create or
  clear local facts by themselves.
- **FR-042 Bounded history:** material lifecycle comments MUST be bounded,
  idempotent, provenance-marked, and reference-first; repeated reconciliation
  MUST NOT duplicate them.
- **FR-043 Missing-local-state reconciliation:** Provider projection/history,
  Repository artifacts, and available local records MAY produce a read-only
  reconciliation or exact recovery plan, but MUST NOT silently reconstruct an
  Execution or infer a transition. Contradictory or insufficient evidence MUST
  return `recovery_required` and require human decision.
- **FR-044 Project metadata policy:** Project configuration MUST be able to
  resolve required/default Work Item and Pull Request metadata through
  provider-neutral intentions and capability results. Provider-specific fields
  and effects remain adapter-owned; only unresolved mandatory values may prompt.

### Runtime invocation

- **FR-018 Known inputs:** supported Runtime skills MUST accept available Project,
  Repository, Work Item, and operation-specific inputs directly under the validated
  host invocation contract.
- **FR-019 Missing-only questions:** supplied valid values MUST be reused; only
  missing or ambiguous values may trigger questions.
- **FR-020 Strict arguments:** unknown, duplicated, or conflicting inputs MUST fail
  clearly. They MUST NOT be ignored or converted into ambient-CWD inference.
- **FR-021 Thin delegation:** parsing/adaptation MAY be Runtime-specific, but every
  validated selector and action MUST reach the same Lingo/application contract as
  the direct CLI path.

## Completion output contract

Every relevant completed CLI command and Runtime skill invocation MUST expose one
canonical semantic result. Human text, Runtime rendering, and structured JSON MAY
vary in syntax, but MUST NOT vary in meaning.

### Required result fields

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `status` | One canonical terminal status from the set below. |
| `result` | Short primary outcome, bounded to one scannable statement. |
| `references` | Relevant Project, Repository, Work Item, Execution, local operation-correlation, Provider, or artifact identifiers/links. Omit only when none exists. |
| `next` | Next safe action when further action is applicable. |
| `details` | Stable reference to a Markdown detail artifact when one exists. |
| `provenance` | Canonical Axiom product/version/build identity. |

Human output SHOULD fit in a compact block and MUST NOT emit large diagnostics,
raw logs, raw model reasoning, or full Evidence by default. Structured output MUST
use stable fields/categories rather than require prose parsing.

### Canonical terminal statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `success` | Requested operation completed with its promised effects confirmed. |
| `failure` | Non-validation, non-retryable operation failure; no later success is implied. |
| `validation_failure` | Input, state, schema, compatibility, or invariant failed before the requested valid transition completed. |
| `denied_authority` | Required authority was absent, refused, stale, or did not cover the exact effects. |
| `partial` | Some effects are confirmed and others did not complete; confirmed effects and remaining work are explicit. |
| `interrupted` | Execution stopped before a terminal operation result; persisted/externally confirmed state is reported without inferred rollback. |
| `retryable_failure` | A transient external or environmental dependency failed and a bounded retry is safe under the stated preconditions. |

An operation MUST NOT classify an unknown or ambiguous side effect as `success`.
`retryable_failure` MUST name the retry boundary and MUST NOT authorize duplicate
external mutation. Application contracts own the classification; skills and
Provider adapters only render it.

## Detailed Markdown artifact contract

A detail artifact MUST be created when information necessary for diagnosis,
review, Evidence, recovery, or continuation would exceed the concise summary;
when a retained failure matrix or validation report is required; or when a
workflow/release gate requires durable Evidence. The summary alone is sufficient
for routine success, expected no-op, simple validation failure, or denied authority
when all actionable facts fit in the primary contract.

Artifacts MUST:

- be Markdown, bounded in size, sanitized, and free of secrets/raw chat history;
- have stable identity independent of a display filename;
- record the applicable Execution reference or local operation-correlation
  identity, creation time, provenance, source references, outcome, and retention
  class;
- be referenced by the completion result and, when it supports a claim, by the
  corresponding Evidence record;
- distinguish diagnostic context from Evidence claims;
- remain machine-local unless an explicit later publication action is separately
  authorized;
- never enter the Portable Project Manifest or portable Project working copy by
  implementation convenience.

HD-2's durable architecture is recorded in
[ADR-0006](../../decisions/0006-machine-local-detail-artifacts.md): one central
Axiom-owned machine-local artifact boundary; stable opaque identity; Execution as
primary owner/correlation when present; a non-domain local correlation identity
before Execution; Evidence references rather than automatic Evidence status;
purpose-based retention; and explicit reference-aware, fail-closed cleanup.
Exact paths, layouts, packages, limits, and retention durations remain Plan work.

## Provenance contract

Axiom-authored textual content on every supported MVP surface MUST carry one
canonical informational provenance model:

| Field | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| product | Exact identity `Axiom`. |
| version | Release semantic version when built as a release; otherwise explicit `development`/unreleased identity. Never invent a release version. |
| revision | Short source revision when embedded or truthfully observable; otherwise explicit `unavailable`. |
| source state | `clean`, `dirty`, or `unknown`. Dirty MUST NOT be presented as the clean revision alone. |

Presentation MAY be a compact footer, header, subtitle, comment, or valid metadata,
depending on surface. CLI/Runtime summaries, Provider Issue/PR bodies and comments,
generated Markdown, and generated source/text files MUST expose equivalent facts
without breaking syntax or overwhelming the summary.

Provenance MUST be produced centrally and supplied to renderers/adapters. A skill,
template, or Provider adapter MUST NOT hardcode an independent version rule.
Transported user text remains user-authored. If Axiom wraps or transforms it, the
marker MUST distinguish Axiom-authored framing from unchanged user content and
MUST NOT claim authorship over the transported content.

## Persistence, recovery, compatibility, and migration

- **FR-022 Authoritative state:** publication MUST expose either the prior complete
  valid state or the new complete valid state, never a partial state as canonical.
- **FR-023 Commit truth:** pre-commit failure preserves prior authority; a confirmed
  post-commit effect is reported as committed even if later sync, local persistence,
  Provider projection, or cleanup fails.
- **FR-024 Filesystem confinement:** writes MUST remain within the exact authorized
  target, with traversal, symlink, hard-link, collision, and replacement protections
  appropriate to the approved threat model.
- **FR-025 Recovery:** recognized interrupted artifacts MUST fail closed with
  deterministic classification and guided recovery. Unknown artifacts MUST be
  preserved. Ambiguous state MUST require operator review and MUST NOT be repaired
  or deleted automatically.
- **FR-026 Schema compatibility:** every portable and local persisted format MUST
  have an explicit version and reader compatibility rule. Missing, malformed,
  unsupported-newer, and unsupported-older versions are distinct failures. State
  safely identified as belonging to the historical POC MUST NOT be treated as
  absent or overwritten; HD-4 requires preservation plus actionable
  backup/export/reconfigure handling, without an automatic in-place migration
  commitment.
- **FR-027 Migration preview:** any mutating migration MUST validate source state,
  show source/target versions and affected roots, identify backup/rollback behavior,
  require exact authority, and revalidate the result.
- **FR-028 Backup and rollback:** migration MUST preserve a recoverable pre-migration
  copy before canonical replacement when rollback cannot otherwise be guaranteed.
  Backup identity, permissions, retention, and cleanup MUST be explicit.
- **FR-029 No silent downgrade:** downgrade or lossy conversion is refused unless a
  separately specified reversible path exists. Newer unknown state is never
  overwritten as if absent.
- **FR-030 Portable/local boundary:** migration MUST NOT move secrets, absolute
  paths, local observations, workflow state, or Execution artifacts into portable
  Project intent.

The residual POC gaps are not silently waived. ADR-0005 maps traversal, supported
link/replacement cases, process concurrency, deterministic injected fault stages,
logical old-or-new publication, permissions/ACL checks, fail-closed uncertainty,
and guided recovery into the supported boundary. Malicious same-UID arbitrary
interleavings, physical power loss, and physical-media durability are explicitly
unsupported guarantees, not solved risks. Compatibility or migration Evidence
remains governed by HD-4's clean-v1 baseline.

## Installation, onboarding, and upgrade

- **FR-031 Supported path:** one published, documented install path MUST work from
  a clean supported environment and yield an inspectable version/provenance result.
- **FR-032 Prerequisites:** missing tools, incompatible platform, invalid destination,
  and unavailable Runtime integration MUST fail with actionable next steps.
- **FR-033 Ownership:** installed binary, receipt, Runtime skills, portable Project
  data, local state, Evidence, and detail artifacts MUST be documented as separate
  ownership/lifecycle categories.
- **FR-034 Safe repetition:** reinstall and upgrade MUST be idempotent for equivalent
  owned content and refuse unowned/conflicting replacement.
- **FR-035 First run:** first-run guidance MUST lead to explicit Project setup and
  MUST NOT configure the CWD implicitly.
- **FR-036 Runtime compatibility:** Lingo and installed Runtime skills MUST expose
  a detectable compatibility result. An incompatible known skill set is upgraded
  only through the authorized install/upgrade flow.
- **FR-037 Upgrade ordering:** binary/Runtime integration and persisted-state
  compatibility checks MUST be ordered so a failed upgrade does not silently leave
  an unusable mixed state. Partial confirmed effects use the completion contract.

HD-1 selects checksummed macOS/Linux binaries plus source installation for
contributors. The exact supported OS/architecture combinations remain a required
Plan/release declaration before distribution.

## Agent Planning and Execution Graph

- **FR-045 Planner proposal:** the Agent Planner MUST derive a proposed topology
  from an approved Plan's outcomes, required capabilities, dependencies, risks and
  validation obligations. It MUST NOT assume fixed frontend/backend/QA/infra roles,
  grant authority, or start a child.
- **FR-046 Validated DAG:** an Execution Graph MUST be finite and acyclic, identify
  one parent and bounded child Executions, declare dependency satisfaction rules,
  and fail before execution on cycles, missing nodes, incompatible scopes, or
  unresolved required inputs.
- **FR-047 Identity and lineage:** every parent and child MUST have a stable opaque
  Execution identity. Each child MUST reference its parent and graph revision;
  parent completion MUST correlate every child attempt, result, artifact and
  Evidence reference without treating an Agent as Execution identity.
- **FR-048 Runtime/Model Profile resolution:** resolution MUST select only an
  installed, enabled and operator-allowlisted Runtime/Model Profile compatible
  with the requested role, capabilities, complexity and budget. Role and Model
  remain independent. Absence of an allowed match MUST block; no implicit Runtime,
  model or lower-cost fallback is permitted.
- **FR-049 Capability contract:** each child MUST declare required capabilities
  independently from its resolved Runtime/Model Profile. Resolution observations
  MUST distinguish configured, installed, available and proven capability rather
  than inferring readiness from a declaration.
- **FR-050 Child scope and authority:** each child MUST receive an immutable bounded
  envelope containing inputs, outputs, Project/Repository target, workspace,
  allowed effects, authority references, dependencies and budget. A child MUST NOT
  widen its own scope, authority, dependencies, Runtime choice or budget.
- **FR-051 Isolation and concurrency:** dependency-ready children MAY run in
  parallel only when their effect sets and workspace strategy are compatible.
  Children that can mutate the same Repository MUST use isolated workspaces or
  worktrees; shared or conflicting mutation MUST serialize or block explicitly.
- **FR-052 Structured coordination:** cross-Runtime questions, answers, contract
  proposals/acceptance, blockers, dependency resolution, artifact publication,
  progress and results MUST be bounded, typed, correlated and Axiom-owned. Raw
  Runtime chat, unrestricted reasoning and untrusted child output MUST NOT become
  workflow truth, authority or Evidence.
- **FR-053 Integration/Reconciliation Execution:** graph delivery MUST include one
  bounded child responsible for validating declared child results, detecting
  conflict or drift, integrating only authorized isolated changes, running required
  combined validation, and publishing a result to the parent. Other children MUST
  NOT silently merge or publish into the delivery branch.
- **FR-054 Budget enforcement:** parent and child ceilings for timeout and supported
  token/cost dimensions MUST be explicit before dispatch. Allocation MUST NOT
  exceed the parent ceiling; automatic budget expansion or purchase is forbidden.
- **FR-055 Truthful usage/cost:** measured Runtime usage and cost MUST retain source,
  unit and observation status. Unavailable or partial provider data MUST remain
  `unavailable` or `partial`; it MUST NOT be estimated or presented as measured.
- **FR-056 Cancellation:** cancellation MUST stop new dispatch, request bounded
  cancellation of affected active children, preserve already confirmed effects,
  and record children as not-started, cancelling, cancelled, completed or unknown
  without claiming rollback.
- **FR-057 Retry:** retry MUST require policy and remaining authority/budget, create
  a new correlated attempt, preserve prior attempts and confirmed effects, and
  refuse ambiguous external-effect replay until reconciliation.
- **FR-058 Partial outcomes:** blocked, failed, cancelled, skipped, unknown and
  successful child outcomes MUST roll up deterministically. Parent success requires
  all required dependencies plus successful Integration/Reconciliation; optional
  or waived outcomes require an explicit human decision where they change scope.
- **FR-059 Evidence and provenance:** each child MUST retain graph/parent identity,
  role, capability request, resolved Runtime/Model Profile, runtime/model version
  when observable, configuration reference, scope/authority/budget, attempts,
  usage/cost observation, result, artifacts and validations. Parent Evidence MUST
  summarize and reference these records without embedding raw chat or secrets.
- **FR-060 Sequential compatibility:** existing ADR-0008 Executions MUST remain
  readable/resumable with unchanged meaning. They are treated as compatible
  sequential executions, not silently rewritten into new child identities or
  attributed to an Agent/Model.
- **FR-061 Human gates:** operator review MUST remain explicit for material graph or
  scope changes, Runtime/Model allowlist changes, stale authority, budget expansion,
  destructive/external effects, conflict resolution, acceptance and S8
  implementation authorization. Automated planning or green validation cannot
  satisfy those decisions.

### S8 security requirements

- Credentials remain Runtime/Integration-owned machine-local references. A parent
  or child receives only the minimum credential capability needed for its effects;
  secrets are never copied through prompts, coordination state, artifacts or
  Evidence merely to share them across Runtimes.
- Command execution uses explicit argument vectors, bounded environment and working
  directory, timeout/cancellation, captured-output limits and exact child authority;
  no child content may introduce shell interpolation, hooks or undeclared tools.
- Repository/worktree selection is validated against the child envelope before
  process start and before integration. Unsafe paths, links, ownership, foreign
  changes, stale bases or cross-worktree targets fail closed.
- Planner, Runtime and child outputs are untrusted data. Prompt/content injection
  cannot amend the graph, authority, allowlist, budget, dependency state or human
  gates. Structured schemas, provenance and deterministic validation precede use.
- Coordination retention is bounded and reference-aware. It excludes raw chat and
  hidden reasoning, sanitizes published fields, and preserves required audit facts
  until parent/Evidence retention permits safe cleanup.
- Cancellation revokes future dispatch authority but does not erase confirmed
  effects. Stale authority, concurrent mutation, unresolved workspace ownership or
  ambiguous cancellation/retry state requires reconciliation before more effects.
- Runtime/model fallback, child authority escalation, child-created children and
  parent-budget expansion are denied unless a new explicit operator decision grants
  the exact changed envelope.

## Failure cases and invariants

The MVP MUST handle at least:

- absent, invalid, ambiguous, or conflicting Project/Repository/Work Item selector;
- unsupported Provider or missing Work Item capability;
- incomplete interview, cancellation, and denied mutation authority;
- invalid/duplicate Runtime arguments;
- Provider unavailable, unauthenticated, rate-limited, invalid response, or
  confirmed mutation followed by local failure;
- failed, interrupted, resumed, stale, or already-completed workflow transition;
- inconsistent lifecycle derivation, unmet canonical gate prerequisite, or absent human decision;
- zero, multiple, unknown, manually changed, or contradictory Provider stage
  markers and auxiliary flags;
- unresolved required Work Item/Pull Request metadata policy;
- missing local Execution with aligned, insufficient, or contradictory
  Provider/Repository recovery signals;
- completion summary rendering failure after confirmed domain/external effect;
- detail-artifact write failure without hiding the primary operation truth;
- released, development, dirty, and revision-unavailable provenance;
- missing/corrupt/newer/older persisted schema;
- interrupted publication or migration, insufficient space, permission denial,
  collision, unsafe links, concurrent writer, and recovery-required state;
- incompatible binary/Runtime skill versions and partial upgrade.
- invalid/cyclic graph, unresolved dependency, incompatible child scope, or stale
  graph revision;
- no operator-allowed Runtime/Model Profile satisfying required capabilities;
- unavailable Runtime, timeout, malformed/untrusted child output, or missing usage
  data;
- child authority/budget escalation, automatic Runtime fallback, or undeclared
  command/tool request;
- worktree collision, stale base, foreign concurrent mutation, integration conflict,
  or combined validation failure;
- cancellation or retry with confirmed, ambiguous, or partially published effects;
- required child blocked/failed/cancelled/unknown while siblings have succeeded.

Global invariants:

1. CWD never supplies Project or Repository identity implicitly.
2. Portable intent never contains secrets or machine-local state.
3. A valid Project does not imply operational workflow readiness.
4. No external mutation occurs without exact authority and review where required.
5. CLI and Runtime skills share application semantics, terminal statuses, and
   provenance; presentation differences do not create parallel contracts.
6. Provider projection cannot advance local workflow truth.
7. Confirmed effects survive truthful reporting; failure never invents rollback.
8. Evidence is inspectable support for a claim, not raw chat history.
9. Axiom provenance never claims authorship over unchanged user content.
10. Automated validation never grants final human acceptance.
11. A valid Execution snapshot derives exactly one lifecycle stage; no second
    lifecycle state is persisted and auxiliary conditions never create synthetic
    stage combinations.
12. `accepted` exists only after an explicit human decision; merge, CI, PR review,
    Issue closure, and Provider status never imply it.
13. Missing local workflow truth is inspected and recovered explicitly, never
    reconstructed or advanced from Provider projection.
14. Execution identity and lineage never collapse into Agent, Role, Runtime or
    Model identity; `Execution != Agent` and `Role != Model` remain exact.
15. A child cannot expand its own scope, authority, effect set, dependencies,
    Runtime/Model selection or budget.
16. Dependency readiness and non-conflicting isolated effects are prerequisites
    for parallel dispatch; completion order never substitutes for declared edges.
17. Parent success requires the declared required children and successful bounded
    Integration/Reconciliation; partial work is never summarized as full success.
18. Raw chat and untrusted Runtime output are neither coordination authority nor
    Evidence. Structured state and retained references remain canonical.
19. No Runtime/model fallback, budget expansion, child spawning or credential
    sharing occurs implicitly.

## Non-functional requirements

- output and diagnostics MUST be deterministic for equivalent input/state, except
  for explicitly identified time/identity fields;
- secrets and rejected sensitive values MUST not enter output, logs, artifacts,
  Evidence, Provider comments, or migration backups;
- user-facing summaries MUST remain bounded and scannable;
- file reads/writes and captured external output MUST be bounded;
- local state and generated artifacts MUST use restrictive platform-appropriate
  permissions and reject unsafe ownership/link conditions;
- supported operations MUST be reproducible without maintainer-local state;
- observability MUST correlate one operation across summary, artifact, Evidence,
  local state, and Provider projection without exposing credentials; under
  ADR-0006, artifacts are subordinate to Execution when one exists, while a
  pre-Execution command uses only an opaque non-domain local correlation identity.
- graph scheduling and roll-up MUST be deterministic for the same validated graph,
  observations and child outcomes; wall-clock completion order MUST NOT alter truth;
- coordination, per-child output and usage records MUST be bounded and resumable;
- cancellation and timeout responsiveness MUST be observable per child without
  converting an unknown Runtime stop into confirmed cancellation;
- aggregate token/cost reporting MUST preserve units, sources and unavailable data
  rather than fabricate cross-Runtime equivalence.

## Observable acceptance criteria

| ID | Observable acceptance |
|---|---|
| AC-01 | Clean installation yields discoverable `lingo`, truthful provenance, and verified Codex integration using only published instructions. |
| AC-02 | First run enters explicit Project setup without treating CWD as Project/Repository. |
| AC-03 | Guided and fully argument-driven setup produce equivalent validated Project/application behavior. |
| AC-04 | Multi-repository portable intent and local absolute bindings remain separate; review precedes publication. |
| AC-05 | An unsupported/missing Work Item Provider capability blocks the workflow explicitly without silently selecting GitHub. |
| AC-06 | Intent-only Work Item creation asks bounded missing questions, presents a structured draft, and mutates GitHub only after authority. |
| AC-07 | Supplied Work Item fields are reused; cancellation and denied authority leave Provider state unchanged. |
| AC-08 | Provider state shows exactly one current workflow-stage marker and idempotent bounded transition comments. |
| AC-09 | Failed/interrupted/resumed workflows remain truthful locally and on the Provider; no later stage is projected early. |
| AC-10 | Fully specified skill invocation needs no selector round trip; partial invocation asks only for missing/ambiguous values. |
| AC-11 | Invalid/conflicting skill arguments fail predictably and never fall back to CWD. |
| AC-12 | Representative CLI and Runtime operations produce semantically equivalent `success`, `failure`, `validation_failure`, `denied_authority`, `partial`, `interrupted`, and `retryable_failure` results. |
| AC-13 | Routine outcomes use only the short summary; oversized diagnosis/Evidence creates one referenced Markdown artifact under the approved ownership/lifecycle contract. |
| AC-14 | Detail artifacts are sanitized, bounded, identity-addressable, correlated, and never silently portable. |
| AC-15 | CLI, Runtime, Provider comments, Markdown, and generated source/text expose equivalent truthful provenance for release, development, dirty, and unavailable-revision builds. |
| AC-16 | Unchanged transported user content is not labeled as Axiom-authored. |
| AC-17 | Supported publication faults preserve old/new complete authority, classify recovery deterministically, and preserve unknown artifacts. |
| AC-18 | Unsupported schema/version combinations fail before destructive mutation; the approved compatibility path detects historical POC state without overwrite and provides its documented clean-install, export/reconfigure, backup, recovery, and, only if separately approved, migration behavior. |
| AC-19 | Reinstall/upgrade is safe and idempotent for owned equivalent content and refuses unowned conflicts. |
| AC-20 | A representative confirmed Provider effect followed by local failure reports `partial` with the confirmed reference and a safe next action. |
| AC-21 | Clean-environment RC dogfood completes install -> first run -> Project -> Work Item -> workflow -> Evidence -> completion through Runtime and direct CLI entrypoints. |
| AC-22 | RC dogfood exercises validation, authority denial, interruption/resume, retryable external failure, recovery-required state, and supported upgrade. |
| AC-23 | Versioned Evidence identifies candidate build, environment, commands, exits, hashes/references, exclusions, and known limitations without raw chat history or secrets. |
| AC-24 | Human explicitly accepts or rejects the Specification and, later, the release candidate; automation never fills either decision. |
| AC-25 | Every valid canonical Execution gate/history plus required-fact combination derives exactly one of the ten Work Item lifecycle stages; GitHub projects it as the exact namespaced label defined by this amendment. |
| AC-26 | Canonical gate transition behavior remains S4-compatible; lifecycle derivation is read-only, and missing/contradictory non-boundary facts return `recovery_required` with zero local or Provider effects. |
| AC-27 | A managed GitHub Issue converges to exactly one lifecycle-stage label plus the applicable independent auxiliary flags without removing foreign content. |
| AC-28 | Material lifecycle history comments remain bounded, reference-first, provenance-marked, and idempotent across replay. |
| AC-29 | Merge, green CI, PR approval, Issue closure, or manual Provider metadata cannot produce `accepted`; only terminal canonical completion plus one explicit revisioned human decision can. |
| AC-30 | With local workflow state unavailable, inspection returns either an exact authorized local-generation recovery plan or `recovery_required`; no Execution or transition is silently synthesized. |
| AC-31 | Project policy deterministically resolves available Work Item/PR metadata, prompts only for unresolved mandatory values, and keeps GitHub-specific fields inside the adapter. |
| AC-32 | One approved Plan yields a finite reviewable DAG whose child roles/capabilities, scopes, dependencies, authority, outputs and budgets derive from work rather than a fixed role template. |
| AC-33 | Cycles, unresolved dependencies, overlapping unsafe effects, stale graph revisions and child self-escalation fail before unauthorized dispatch or mutation. |
| AC-34 | Runtime/Model Profile resolution selects only installed, available, capable and operator-allowlisted choices; no match blocks and no implicit fallback occurs. |
| AC-35 | At least two dependency-independent children execute concurrently in isolated workspaces, while dependent or conflicting work remains blocked/serialized. |
| AC-36 | At least two real authorized Runtime paths participate in one acceptance graph with per-child Runtime/Model/configuration provenance. |
| AC-37 | Children exchange at least one bounded structured question/answer or contract and publish correlated artifacts/results without raw chat becoming workflow truth or Evidence. |
| AC-38 | Integration/Reconciliation detects drift/conflict, integrates only authorized child results, runs combined validation, and alone may produce the integrated delivery result. |
| AC-39 | Parent and child timeout/token/cost ceilings are enforced; measured usage retains source/unit and missing provider data remains explicitly unavailable. |
| AC-40 | Cancellation stops new dispatch and reports each child truthfully; retry creates a correlated attempt and never duplicates an ambiguous external effect. |
| AC-41 | Required child failure, blocker, cancellation or unknown result produces deterministic partial/non-success parent truth while preserving successful sibling results and confirmed effects. |
| AC-42 | Parent Evidence traces graph revision, lineage, authority, budgets, coordination, artifacts, validations, child attempts/results and usage without secrets, unrestricted reasoning or raw chat. |
| AC-43 | Existing sequential Executions remain readable/resumable with unchanged identity and semantics after graph support is introduced. |

## Required acceptance Evidence

Release-candidate Evidence MUST include:

- exact Axiom version, source revision/state, platform, architecture, Runtime and
  Provider adapter versions;
- clean-environment construction and prerequisite inventory;
- installation and upgrade commands with exit statuses and installed checksums;
- CLI/Runtime semantic-equivalence matrix for every terminal status;
- Project portable/local separation and multi-repository observations;
- Work Item draft/authority and Provider projection references;
- workflow gate transitions, interruption/resume, artifact identities/digests,
  and final completion reference;
- Work Item gate/fact-to-lifecycle derivation and flag matrix, exactly-one-stage Provider observations,
  bounded-history replay, missing-local-state reconciliation, and metadata-policy
  resolution/non-prompt observations;
- Agent Planner input and normalized graph proposal, validation result and graph
  revision, including cycle/overlap/stale-authority denials with zero effects;
- operator allowlist/configuration references and per-child capability request,
  resolved Runtime/Model Profile, availability observation, scope, authority,
  workspace and budget without credential values;
- scheduler dependency/parallelism trace proving at least two independent children
  ran concurrently, plus serialization of dependent/conflicting children;
- bounded structured coordination, child artifact/result publication and the
  Integration/Reconciliation result with combined validation;
- cancellation, timeout, retry, partial/unknown roll-up, confirmed-effect and
  no-implicit-fallback observations;
- per-child and aggregate usage/cost records with source/unit/availability and at
  least two real authorized Runtime paths;
- sequential ADR-0008 compatibility observations;
- provenance observations on each supported generated surface;
- filesystem fault/recovery and compatibility-transition matrix tied to the
  approved threat model, including migration Evidence only when migration is part
  of the approved path;
- secret/sensitive-file and security review results;
- relevant unit, integration, functional black-box, race, vet, build, module,
  repository, and documentation validation results;
- known limitations, unexecuted checks, and explicit human acceptance/rejection.

At least one acceptance run MUST use an isolated environment without existing
Axiom state. Controlled fakes MAY prove deterministic external failures, but the
supported Provider/Runtime journey requires a bounded real integration observation
before final acceptance. Every external mutation remains explicitly authorized.

## Delivery dependencies

```text
#62 Specification approval
  |
  +--> #54 Project setup
  +--> #55 Work Item intent
  +--> #56 Provider projection
  +--> #57 Runtime arguments
  +--> #63 output + detail artifacts
  +--> #64 provenance
  +--> #66 persistence + migration
  +--> #67 install + upgrade + onboarding
         |
         +--> #97 multi-runtime Agent Planning + Execution Graph
                |
                +--> #68 clean RC dogfood + docs + human acceptance
```

If authorized after the human decisions and required reconciliations, a future
Plan may reorder independently implementable units but MUST preserve
contract dependencies: provenance and completion semantics precede surface-wide
adoption; artifact ownership precedes persistence; migration policy precedes
upgrade; all delivered blocks precede #68. Approval of this Specification permits
the next expressly authorized phase only and does not itself authorize Plan work,
any delivery issue, implementation, or release.

The Issue #94 amendment adds one bounded Slice after delivered S5 and before the
current recovery/upgrade Slice. Its lifecycle/gate/projection/recovery-signal and
metadata-policy contracts must be delivered before compatibility hardening and RC
acceptance can claim the amended Work Item journey. Existing S4/S5 Tasks and
Evidence remain unchanged historical delivery records.

Issue #97 adds S8 after delivered S7. The former release-candidate S8 becomes S9;
T23–T25 keep their IDs and scope. S8 graph behavior, proposed ADR-0009, amended
Plan and Tasks require explicit human approval, followed by separate implementation
authorization. No proposal, validation, commit or merge supplies those gates.

## Requirements, details, and open questions

| Classification | This Specification |
|---|---|
| Requirement | Observable journeys, FR/AC contracts, failure states, invariants, Evidence, and preserved boundaries above, including approved FR-038–FR-044/AC-25–AC-31 and proposed FR-045–FR-061/AC-32–AC-43. |
| Implementation detail deferred to Plan | CLI framework, concrete Go packages/interfaces, exact JSON schema, prompt UI, filesystem syscalls, migration algorithm, installer implementation, artifact filename rendering, lifecycle/graph-record encoding, scheduler mechanism, concrete Runtime adapters, concrete model names and metadata-policy schema. GitHub label spelling is fixed only for the Issue #94 adapter projection. |
| Human decisions recorded | HD-1 through HD-4 and complete original Specification approval were recorded on 2026-09-20. ADR-0005/0006 directly formalize HD-3/HD-2. The Issue #94 amendment, FR-038–FR-044, AC-25–AC-31, S6 placement, and Specification 002 policy-reference clarification were explicitly approved on 2026-09-24. Issue #97 records the S8 product-scope direction on 2026-09-26; proposed FR-045–FR-061, AC-32–AC-43, ADR-0009, Plan and Tasks still require explicit human review. |

## Human decisions recorded — 2026-09-20

These decisions were explicitly recorded during human review of PR #69. They
resolve the material directions needed by this Specification but do not by
themselves approve the complete Specification or authorize Plan, Tasks,
implementation, accepted ADRs, or release work.

### HD-1 — Supported release installation and platforms

**Decision:** use published checksummed binaries for macOS/Linux, while retaining
source installation for contributors.

The authorized Plan and release contract MUST explicitly declare the supported
OS/architecture combinations before distribution. Candidate combinations include
`darwin/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `linux/amd64`, and `linux/arm64`; this
decision does not silently promise every candidate. Any combination not explicitly
declared is unsupported for that release.

Package-manager distribution, automatic updating, Windows support, signing, and
notarization remain outside the MVP unless separately decided.

### HD-2 — Detailed artifact ownership and lifecycle

**Decision:** detail artifacts are durable, machine-local artifacts retained while
needed by workflow/Evidence and removed only through explicit safe cleanup. They
MUST NOT enter the Portable Project Manifest or portable Project working copy.

This decision intentionally does not create an `operation-attempt` entity parallel
to Execution. Before implementation, an ADR MUST define final ownership/location,
Evidence relation, retention and cleanup, and decide whether attempt identity is
subordinate to Execution or whether pre-Execution commands use only non-domain
local correlation identity.

### HD-3 — MVP filesystem threat model

**Decision:** adopt the bounded local threat model.

The supported boundary retains:

- confinement to the exact authorized target;
- traversal and supported symlink/link protections;
- process concurrency protection;
- deterministic injected fault stages;
- fail-closed uncertainty;
- guided recovery;
- protection against partial or invalid canonical state.

The MVP explicitly excludes guarantees against malicious same-UID actors performing
arbitrary interleavings and against physical power loss/media durability. These are
unsupported guarantees, not solved risks.

Because this narrows previously approved proof expectations, Specification 002 and
all affected security/architecture contracts MUST be reconciled before any Plan for
Specification 004 is authorized. The reconciliation/ADR MUST state supported and
excluded threats, still-mandatory properties, required Evidence, and the exact
relationship to Specification 002 SEC-003/SEC-005.

### HD-4 — Compatibility baseline and historical POC state

**Decision:** clean v1 installation is the officially supported compatibility
baseline.

`v0.1.0-poc.1` remains a historical snapshot without an automatic compatibility
or migration commitment. When POC-owned state is recognized, v1 MUST NOT treat it
as absent or overwrite it. The supported path provides actionable diagnostics and
preserves backup/export where applicable, followed by explicit export/reconfigure.

In-place migration from the POC remains unsupported unless a later bounded
compatibility/ADR decision proves it safe and explicitly authorizes it. Unknown
newer formats fail closed; unsupported older formats are diagnosed explicitly; no
migration or downgrade is silent; no generic N-1 or arbitrary historical
compatibility is promised.

## ADR status and remaining candidates

- **Accepted from HD-2:**
  [ADR-0006](../../decisions/0006-machine-local-detail-artifacts.md) defines
  machine-local ownership, Execution-first/pre-Execution correlation, Evidence
  relation, retention, uncertainty, and safe cleanup without creating an
  operation-attempt domain entity.
- **Accepted from HD-3:**
  [ADR-0005](../../decisions/0005-bounded-local-filesystem-threat-model.md) defines
  the supported and excluded threats, mandatory persistence/recovery properties,
  and Specification 002 SEC-003/SEC-005 proof boundary.
- **Required before any in-place POC migration:** specific persisted-schema
  compatibility and migration/rollback decision; clean install plus
  export/reconfigure does not itself accept such migration.
- **Assess during an authorized Plan under HD-1:** distribution/supply-chain ADR
  if published binaries establish a durable release topology or trust boundary. A
  routine source installer alone does not justify an ADR.

ADR-0005 and ADR-0006 introduce no material choice beyond approved HD-3 and HD-2.
Other candidate decisions remain unaccepted.

### Issue #94 ADR assessment

No new ADR is proposed. The amendment keeps the existing durable decisions:

- ADR-0003 keeps executable workflow behavior in Lingo under Axiom contracts;
- ADR-0004 keeps Project policy portable and local workflow observations/state
  machine-local;
- ADR-0007 remains the local commit/recovery authority;
- ADR-0008 remains the single stable Execution lineage and explicitly forbids
  reconstruction from Provider metadata.

The derived lifecycle projection, flags, bounded Provider history, recovery
inspection, and metadata-policy capability extend the approved Specification 004
contract without changing source-of-truth ownership, Execution identity/gate
semantics, Provider abstraction ownership, or fundamental recovery semantics.
ADR-0008 therefore remains valid without alteration: no second lifecycle field,
transition history, identity, or authority is introduced. Stop and reassess an ADR
if implementation instead requires a second workflow authority, portable/shared
Execution state, Provider-owned gates, a generic metadata/custom-field schema, or
silent reconstruction of local truth.

### Issue #97 ADR assessment

[ADR-0009](../../decisions/0009-parent-child-execution-graph.md) is proposed because
parent/child identity, DAG dependency semantics, authority inheritance, retry and
cancellation truth, integration ownership, structured coordination and
cross-Runtime Evidence are durable cross-cutting choices. ADR-0008 remains the
accepted historical basis for S4–S7 and existing sequential records. If ADR-0009
is accepted, it evolves new graph executions while preserving sequential
compatibility; this Specification does not rewrite ADR-0008 or treat the proposal
as accepted.

## Constitution check

- Intent, actors, constraints, non-goals, failures, acceptance, and Evidence
  precede implementation.
- POC facts remain Evidence; experimental implementation does not silently define
  MVP contracts.
- Material architecture, security, compatibility, and ownership choices are
  recorded as explicit human decisions; required reconciliation and ADR gates
  remain enforceable.
- Deterministic classifications and stable references take precedence over prose
  or model judgment.
- Least privilege, exact mutation authority, portable/local separation, and
  honest partial outcomes are normative.
- Project remains distinct from Repository and runtime/provider products remain
  outside the domain core.
- Final acceptance remains human and separate from validation or merge.

## Review gate

HD-1 through HD-4 are recorded and the complete Specification was explicitly
approved by the human reviewer on 2026-09-20. The authorized reconciliation
produces ADR-0005/0006 and aligns Specification 002 plus affected architecture
contracts. Merge and human approval of that reconciliation remain the gate before
Plan. No Plan, Tasks, implementation, migration, installer, or release is
authorized by these documentation changes.

**Next artifact after merge and human approval of this reconciliation: Plan for Specification 004**

### Issue #94 amendment approval — 2026-09-24

The original review record above remains historical. Human review explicitly
approved FR-038–FR-044, AC-25–AC-31, the S6 delivery placement, and the
Specification 002 policy-reference clarification on 2026-09-24. This satisfies the
amendment decision gate. Merge, checks, Issue labels, or closure did not substitute
for that decision. T26–T29 implementation and successor Slice work remain
separately gated and are not started by this approval or merge.

### Issue #97 S8 amendment proposal — 2026-09-26

Issue #97 records the human product-scope decision to add S8 before release-candidate
acceptance. This repository amendment defines proposed FR-045–FR-061 and
AC-32–AC-43, proposes ADR-0009, renumbers the former RC slice to S9 while preserving
T23–T25, and prepares amended Plan/Tasks for review. **Human decision required:**
approve, revise, or reject the proposed Specification/ADR/Plan/Tasks. Even approval
would not authorize S8 implementation, Runtime execution, external mutation,
release publication or final acceptance.

**Next artifact after human approval: explicit S8 implementation authorization for
the approved T30–T36 boundary.**

Before that authorization, human review must explicitly settle:

- approval, revision or rejection of FR-045–FR-061, AC-32–AC-43 and ADR-0009;
- the two or more supported Runtime paths and allowed Model Profiles for acceptance,
  without turning those choices into domain-owned rankings;
- enforceable budget dimensions/default ceilings where Runtimes expose different
  token/cost data, preserving unavailable data truthfully;
- the representative engineering activity and exact real-run authority/cleanup
  envelope for T36;
- amended Plan/Tasks approval and, separately, S8 implementation authorization.
