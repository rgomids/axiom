# Specification 004 — Usable MVP v1 Baseline

## Platform reconciliation — 2026-09-28

The human T23 instruction names supported operating systems generically as
**macOS** and **Linux**. The current versioned release build at
`fd97fc7d39810a2ffad9a104e4be8779c726f9ee` targets macOS/arm64,
Linux/amd64 and Linux/arm64; Linux archives use `linux` metadata and no
Ubuntu/version filter. This reconciles the already implemented Linux contract,
without changing architecture, filesystem/security invariants or native Evidence
obligations. Earlier Ubuntu-specific support wording is superseded; dated
observations and research remain historical, not current product requirements.
The macOS installer still requires 27.0/arm64 and archive metadata `macos-27`;
generic OS naming does not remove that executable compatibility constraint.
T24, Runtime execution and human acceptance remain separately gated.

## S9 dogfood defect reconciliation — 2026-09-29

The S9 dogfood against `v0.1.2-rc.1` found two Major product defects. Their
correction clarifies two existing contracts without changing architecture, the
closed stage set, or recorded Evidence; this clarification is pending human
review with the correcting pull request:

- **Execution Runtime (FR-018, ADR-0008 record):** the Runtime ID persisted in an
  Execution is the Runtime explicitly selected at `workflow start`
  (`--runtime codex|claude`; absent keeps the historical `codex` default). It is
  never inferred from executables or the parent process. After start the persisted
  Runtime is Execution truth; later operations cannot re-select or switch it.
- **First projection (FR-039, AC-08, AC-27):** zero `axiom:stage:*` markers are
  drift only once the Execution's projection ledger shows an established marker.
  The first projection of an Issue that never carried one (for example, created by
  `work-item create`) is a bootstrap that creates and adds the derived marker.
  Multiple, unknown, invalid, or contradictory markers still fail closed.

Dated observations of `v0.1.2-rc.1` remain historical and are not rewritten.

## Installed Project source reconciliation — 2026-10-01

Issue #147 found that Work Item resolution read an installed Project's portable
configuration from `<projects-root>/<slug>` instead of the configuration source
location recorded by its installation. The correction clarifies FR-003 without
changing architecture, ADR-0004/ADR-0005, `project install`, Repository binding
semantics, or recorded Evidence; this clarification is pending human review with
the correcting pull request:

- **Recorded source (FR-003):** consumers resolving the portable configuration of
  an installed Project use the configuration source recorded by that
  installation; they must not infer a different source from the Project slug.
  The configuration source location is machine-local installation data
  (Specification 002, "Portable configuration and local state").
- **Coherence:** the configuration observed at the recorded source is used only
  when its Project ID, slug and portable revision equal the record's Project ID,
  observed slug and recorded portable revision. Divergence, an absent or unsafe
  source, recovery-required state, or cancellation fails closed with an explicit
  category and no side effects; a configuration found at another location never
  substitutes for the recorded one.

## Issue #153 forward-compatibility reconciliation — 2026-10-01

Issue [#153](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/153) exposed a gap between
the historical HD-4 compatibility baseline and the later FR-065/T39 convergent
installer contract. The human decision recorded on 2026-10-01 resolves that gap
without accepting implicit in-place migration of historical workflow truth:

- RecognizedPOC MUST resolve to the canonical installer's bounded
  **preserve -> clean rebuild -> supported reconfiguration** transition when its
  preservation/lifecycle policy and exact authority preconditions are satisfied;
  otherwise the installer MUST refuse before mutation with actionable diagnostics;
- historical POC Execution/workflow truth remains historical and MUST NOT be
  promoted silently into current canonical Execution/workflow state;
- valid portable Project intent MAY be reconstructed only through the current
  validated portable contract;
- the current supported stable persisted-state compatibility window contains
  only canonical v1; RecognizedPOC is a separately supported historical transition,
  not a member of that stable window;
- any future stable release that introduces a new persisted-state format MUST,
  before publication, declare the exact earlier stable persisted-state formats
  that remain supported and the forward strategy for each;
- owned/recognized state and migratable state remain distinct classifications;
- foreign, modified, unsafe, ambiguous, corrupt, unsupported-newer and
  out-of-window state continue to fail closed.

This reconciliation authorizes the compatibility-policy direction only. It does
not authorize implementation, destructive mutation, release, or merge.
## Status and authority

**Approved — human approval recorded on 2026-09-20.**

**Issue #94 amendment: Approved, and S6 T26–T29 implementation explicitly authorized on 2026-09-24. Technical implementation is recorded at `56beb4fc310894ff8de128f52c6a96d22711bec8`; human acceptance is not inferred.**

**S7 (T16–T22): explicitly authorized on 2026-09-25. Technical implementation is recorded at `11f2b7decbe4ddef428d4cb3b7e962680100e1db` and `408a2b51f20e797744f9f6ba6eaa00e0061582f9` with [S7 Evidence](evidence-s7.md); T22 Linux native rows remain unexecuted; human acceptance is not inferred.**

**Issue #97 S8 amendment: Approved by explicit human decision on 2026-09-26. It
adds multi-runtime Agent Planning and parent/child Execution Graph behavior before
the release-candidate slice, accepts ADR-0009, and approves the amended Plan and
Tasks. S8/T30–T36 implementation was separately authorized on 2026-09-27. The
T36 Runtime run then received its own exact authority and produced the recorded
real Codex + Claude Evidence. The corrected candidate is **S8 ready for human
review**; human acceptance, S9/T23–T25, merge, release, deploy and Provider
mutation remain separate.**

**Issue #81 S9 product-scope amendment: product direction recorded by explicit
human decision on 2026-09-27. S9 now includes productization before RC acceptance:
the public `axiom` CLI identity, automated supported-platform release artifacts,
a stable idempotent remote installer with safe owned upgrade, Codex + Claude
first-run bootstrap, and Axiom dogfooding through its own S8 orchestration path.
This scope decision does not by itself authorize S9 implementation, prerelease
publication, Runtime/Provider effects, or final MVP acceptance.**

Tracked by [#62](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/62) under the
[MVP tracker #15](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/15). Human approval of
this Specification was recorded on 2026-09-20. That approval fixed the original
MVP behavioral baseline but did not authorize Tasks, implementation, release,
migration, or external Provider mutation. At that decision point HD-3 blocked Plan
authorization until Specification 002 and the affected security/architecture
contracts were reconciled and approved. The later authorized reconciliation records
[ADR-0005](../../decisions/0005-bounded-local-filesystem-threat-model.md) for HD-3
and [ADR-0006](../../decisions/0006-machine-local-detail-artifacts.md) for HD-2.
Their acceptance follows directly from the already approved human decisions and
does not authorize Plan, Tasks, or implementation.

The E2E Codex POC was explicitly accepted on 2026-09-20 and is historical
Evidence for this Specification. Its experimental commands, formats, storage
choices, and adapters become MVP contracts only where this Specification or an
existing accepted decision says so.

The approved Issue #94 amendment reconciles the delivered S4/S5 baseline with a
durable Work Item lifecycle contract. It does not rewrite S4/S5 history, authorize
implementation, advance S6+, or infer human acceptance from review, merge, CI,
Issue closure, or Provider state.

Normative terms `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY` follow the
[Axiom Constitution](../../product/constitution.md).

## Source baseline

This draft reconciles:

- MVP outcome and delivery boundary in #15;
- guided Project setup in #54;
- Intent-driven Work Item creation in #55;
- Provider-visible workflow projection in #56;
- Runtime skill selectors in #57;
- completion output and detailed artifacts in #63;
- generated-text provenance in #64;
- persistence, recovery, compatibility, and migrations in #66;
- installation, upgrade, and onboarding in #67;
- clean-environment release-candidate acceptance in #68;
- accepted Specifications 002 and 003, their clarifications, Plans, and Evidence;
- ADR-0001 through ADR-0004, the conceptual model, Provider boundaries, product
  roadmap, and Constitution.
- delivered S4/S5 implementation and Evidence in PRs #91 and #93;
- Issue #94's approved durable Work Item lifecycle and metadata-governance amendment.
- Issue #97's recorded product-scope decision and the explicit 2026-09-26 human
  approval of the multi-runtime Agent Planning and multi-agent execution contracts.

## Reconciliation findings

### Already decided

- POC acceptance is historical Evidence, not MVP implementation authority.
- Axiom/Lingo, Project/Repository, Runtime/domain, Provider/Transport,
  Integration/MCP, portable/local, authority, and human-acceptance boundaries are
  already accepted and are preserved below.
- The delivered S1–S7 path is Codex + Lingo + GitHub Issues + one sequential
  workflow. Issue #97 explicitly adds a bounded multi-runtime Execution Graph to
  the MVP after that historical baseline and before release-candidate acceptance.
- Project mutation, Provider mutation, optional Git effects, technical validation,
  and human acceptance are separate outcomes/authority gates.
- Unknown or invalid persisted state fails closed; it is never treated as absent
  or permission to overwrite.

### Human decisions recorded on 2026-09-20

Human review of PR #69 records the following directions:

- **HD-1:** use published checksummed binaries for macOS/Linux, retaining source
  installation for contributors. The authorized Plan/release contract MUST declare
  the exact supported OS/architecture matrix before distribution.
- **HD-2:** keep detailed artifacts durable and machine-local while required by
  workflow/Evidence, with explicit safe cleanup. They are not portable Project
  content. An ADR MUST define their final ownership/lifecycle and the relationship
  between Execution and any pre-Execution correlation identity.
- **HD-3:** use a bounded local filesystem threat model that preserves authorized
  target confinement, supported path/link protection, process concurrency,
  deterministic fault stages, fail-closed uncertainty, guided recovery, and
  protection against partial/invalid canonical state. Malicious same-UID arbitrary
  interleavings and physical power-loss/media-durability guarantees are excluded.
  Specification 002 plus affected security/architecture contracts MUST be
  reconciled before any Plan for Specification 004.
- **HD-4:** use clean v1 installation as the officially supported compatibility
  baseline. Historical POC state is detected and preserved with actionable
  backup/export/reconfigure behavior when applicable; no in-place POC migration
  commitment exists without a later explicit compatibility decision and Evidence.

### Apparent conflicts resolved without changing accepted decisions

- Specification 002 allows a portable-valid Project with no Provider; #54 asks
  setup to collect a Work Item Provider. This draft keeps Provider optional for
  portable validity but requires a supported Work Item capability before the MVP
  Work Item workflow can run.
- #56 requests Provider-visible stages while local state remains authoritative.
  This draft treats Provider metadata as an idempotent projection, not workflow
  ownership.
- #57 shows illustrative command-like skill arguments, while the accepted POC
  proves only the current Codex standalone skill contract. This draft specifies
  selector semantics and defers exact host syntax to validated planning/Evidence.
- #64 applies provenance to Axiom-authored text but forbids claiming transported
  user content. This draft uses one central provenance envelope and requires
  renderers to distinguish Axiom framing from unchanged user text.

No approved Specification or ADR is superseded merely by this draft. The
recorded HD-3 decision requires Specification 002 and the affected security and
architecture contracts to be reconciled before Plan authorization. HD-4 establishes
clean v1 as the compatibility baseline; any future in-place historical migration
requires a separate explicit compatibility decision before implementation.

### Issue #94 amendment — durable Work Item lifecycle anchor

The Work Item is the durable operational anchor that a human can inspect across
machines and after loss of ordinary local availability. It is not a replacement
for either authoritative layer:

```text
Repository artifacts = versioned technical source of truth
Local Execution/workflow state = canonical workflow truth
Provider Work Item = authorized durable projection and recovery signal
```

The amendment introduces a provider-neutral `WorkItemLifecycleStage` projection:

```text
intake
-> specifying
-> specified
-> planning
-> planned
-> implementing
-> implemented
-> reviewing
-> reviewed
-> accepted
```

This lifecycle stage is a deterministic, read-only projection of S4's canonical
Execution gate, its revisioned transition facts, and the explicit human decisions
listed below. It is not persisted or transitioned independently. The only workflow
state machine remains `intake -> specification -> clarification -> plan -> tasks ->
implementation -> review -> evidence -> reconciliation -> completion` under the
existing Execution revision and lineage.

| Canonical local condition | Additional required fact | Derived lifecycle stage |
|---|---|---|
| current gate `intake` | none beyond valid Execution scope | `intake` |
| current gate `specification` or `clarification` | none beyond valid prior gate history | `specifying` |
| current gate `plan` | Specification/Decision references and all required Specification decisions exist; planning authority is not yet recorded | `specified` |
| current gate `plan` with planning authority, or current gate `tasks` | revisioned explicit planning authority; `tasks` also requires the prior Plan transition/reference | `planning` |
| current gate `implementation` without implementation authority | approved Plan/Tasks references and validation plus required human Plan/Tasks approval | `planned` |
| current gate `implementation` with implementation authority | revisioned exact implementation scope and explicit implementation authority | `implementing` |
| current gate `review` before review starts | implementation result and applicable deterministic validation/Evidence references | `implemented` |
| current gate `review` after review starts, or current gate `evidence` or `reconciliation` | revisioned review-start fact; later gates also require the preceding review/Evidence transition facts | `reviewing` |
| current gate `completion` without explicit human acceptance | completed review, resolved or explicitly decided blocking findings, Evidence, and reconciliation references | `reviewed` |
| terminally completed `completion` gate with explicit human acceptance | revisioned human decision identifying the bounded accepted outcome | `accepted` |

Absence of a start/authority fact at the three intentional boundaries above
(`plan`, `implementation`, or `review`) keeps the derived stage at `specified`,
`planned`, or `implemented`; it does not invent a transition. Any other missing,
stale, contradictory, out-of-order, or scope-mismatched prerequisite makes the
derivation `recovery_required`. It MUST NOT select a best-effort stage, mutate the
Execution, or prepare Provider effects.

For GitHub, the exact adapter projection is:

```text
axiom:stage:intake
axiom:stage:specifying
axiom:stage:specified
axiom:stage:planning
axiom:stage:planned
axiom:stage:implementing
axiom:stage:implemented
axiom:stage:reviewing
axiom:stage:reviewed
axiom:stage:accepted
```

A successfully managed GitHub Work Item MUST expose exactly one marker from that
closed set. Zero, multiple, unknown, or contradictory `axiom:stage:*` observations
are projection drift and MUST fail closed for Provider reconciliation; zero markers
before the Execution's first established projection are the bootstrap defined by
the 2026-09-29 dogfood defect reconciliation, not drift. They do not
advance, rewind, or veto an otherwise valid canonical local gate transition.

Orthogonal conditions use zero or more separate provider-neutral flags. The
GitHub adapter maps the MVP set exactly to:

```text
axiom:blocked
axiom:needs-decision
axiom:needs-approval
axiom:recovery-required
```

Flags MUST NOT multiply or rename lifecycle stages. Provider flag mutation does
not create the corresponding local fact; it is only a signal to inspect and
reconcile.

A valid local `blocked` condition remains orthogonal to lifecycle derivation. For
example, an `implementation` gate with valid implementation authority still
derives `implementing` while `blocked` is true and projects both
`axiom:stage:implementing` and `axiom:blocked`. The blocker does not make the
Execution inconsistent, change its derived stage, or produce
`recovery_required`.

Canonical gate transitions remain the explicit local operations. Each transition
MUST validate the current gate, expected Execution revision, required artifacts and
decisions, applicable authority, blockers, and next gate before committing. The
lifecycle projection is recomputed only from the resulting valid local snapshot.
When an applicable blocker prevents the next transition, the operation MUST deny
the transition before mutation, keep the canonical gate unchanged, infer no new
authority, and continue deriving the lifecycle stage and independent `blocked`
condition from the current valid snapshot. Such a denial becomes
`recovery_required` only when the underlying facts are stale, incompatible,
contradictory, unknown, insufficient, out of order, scope-mismatched, or otherwise
do not identify one valid local truth.
Merge, green CI, PR approval, Issue closure, Project status, or Provider labels
MUST NOT create any local fact or satisfy human acceptance.

`reviewed` means the canonical `review`, `evidence`, and `reconciliation` work has
passed and the Execution has reached `completion`; merely entering `review`,
producing Evidence, or obtaining technical/Provider approval is insufficient.
`completion` remains the detailed canonical gate and terminal result boundary.
`accepted` is projected only after that gate is terminally completed and the
bounded outcome has a separate explicit human acceptance decision.

Material changes in the derived lifecycle stage MAY project one bounded idempotent
operational comment. Such a comment contains only a transition/outcome summary, stable
references to Specification/Plan/Tasks/PR/Evidence or other artifacts, and the
next action or blocker. Dense documents, raw logs, chat, unrestricted reasoning,
and copied Evidence do not belong in Provider comments.

Recovery inspection combines Provider stage/flags and bounded transition history
with Repository artifacts and available local records. It may return only:

- current local truth plus a projection-reconciliation preview;
- a validated ADR-0007 recovery plan for an identified prior/new local generation,
  requiring fresh exact authority before mutation; or
- `recovery_required` with the observed contradiction/insufficiency and the human
  decision needed.

Provider and Repository evidence alone MUST NOT silently create an Execution,
select a lifecycle stage, replay a gate transition, create a required local fact,
or grant implementation/acceptance authority.

A Project MAY declare a bounded metadata policy for Work Item and Pull Request
operations. The domain expresses required/default metadata intentions and required
capabilities; provider adapters resolve concrete fields and effects. For GitHub,
the adapter may resolve labels, assignee, milestone, supported Project/status,
and Pull Request labels/assignee/review metadata. Axiom asks the user only for a
required value that remains unresolved after deterministic Project policy and
operation-context resolution. Arbitrary custom fields, a generic workflow engine,
and broad GitHub Projects automation remain outside the MVP.

The MVP intention set is closed to `classification`, `owner`, `delivery_target`,
`tracking_state`, and Pull Request `reviewers`. It uses Specification 002's existing
`policies` document references; it adds no field to the closed `schemaVersion: 1`
manifest. The referenced Work Item metadata policy has its own strict version and
closed schema; unsupported versions fail without migration. Lifecycle stage/flags
remain owned by workflow projection and are not metadata-policy inputs. Provider
observations, identity bindings, credentials, concrete field names, and effect
ledgers remain machine-local or adapter-owned rather than portable domain values.

## Intake

### Problem

The accepted POC proves one local value path, but another developer still needs
project-history knowledge to configure a Project, capture Intent, understand
workflow progress, interpret completion, diagnose failures, identify generated
content, recover state, and upgrade safely. Current behavior is useful Evidence,
not a stable v1 user contract.

### Desired outcome

A developer in a clean supported environment can install Axiom, discover Lingo
and the supported Runtime integration, intentionally configure a Project, create
or select a Work Item, run the bounded Axiom workflow, inspect Evidence, recover
truthfully from supported failures, upgrade through the supported path, and reach
a concise completion result ready for explicit human acceptance.

### Primary actors

- developer configuring and operating a local Axiom Project;
- reviewer deciding Specification, release-candidate, and final MVP acceptance;
- Runtime adapter invoking thin skills;
- Work Item Provider adapter projecting authorized workflow state.

### Constraints

- local-first operation;
- Codex remains the delivered Runtime path through S7; S8 acceptance requires the
  two concrete operator-authorized Runtime paths Codex and Claude without making
  either Runtime a domain owner or silently broadening the allowlist;
- GitHub Issues is the first supported Work Item Provider adapter, without
  making GitHub a domain requirement;
- macOS and Linux are the selected release OS boundary; the authorized
  Plan/release contract MUST declare the exact supported OS/architecture
  combinations before distribution;
- deterministic application/domain contracts remain usable without model
  judgment where interpretation or generation is not required;
- external mutation, migration, and destructive recovery require explicit
  authority appropriate to their effects.

## Non-goals

The following exclusions consolidate the existing MVP tracker and related-issue
boundaries. They constrain the MVP; they do not establish new behavior or relax
requirements inside the supported local contract:

- mandatory support for multiple external Providers;
- an arbitrary Runtime plugin ecosystem or universal model broker;
- unlimited autonomous Agent Planning or child spawning;
- distributed execution across multiple user machines;
- a cloud control plane;
- multi-tenancy;
- remote collaboration or synchronization;
- distributed persistence or remote locking;
- automatic updating;
- support for every package manager;
- Windows support for the MVP;
- signing, notarization, cryptographic provenance, attestation, or equivalent
  release trust mechanisms unless a future specific decision authorizes them;
  the informational provenance contract below remains required;
- production-grade durability beyond the explicitly supported local MVP contract;
- storing raw chat history as Evidence;
- making detailed artifacts part of portable Project intent;
- general backwards-compatibility guarantees across arbitrary historical
  versions.

## Preserved architectural boundaries

The MVP MUST preserve:

- `Axiom != Lingo`: Axiom owns product/domain/policies/contracts; Lingo executes
  or coordinates them locally;
- `Project != Repository`: one Project may associate multiple independent
  Repositories and no caller CWD becomes Project identity;
- `Role != Model`;
- `Execution != Agent`;
- `Provider != Transport`;
- `Integration != MCP`;
- `Skill != workflow source of truth`;
- `Evidence != raw chat history`;
- portable Project intent is distinct from machine-local state;
- `Runtime skill -> Lingo/application -> Axiom contracts`;
- Provider projection is reconcilable output; local validated workflow state
  remains authoritative for execution;
- user authority, green checks, technical review, merge, Provider closure, and
  human acceptance remain distinct states.

Runtime skills MUST remain thin entrypoints. They MUST NOT duplicate domain,
workflow, output, provenance, authority, persistence, or recovery rules.

## Supported MVP boundary

The delivered S1–S7 baseline supports one local, sequential delivery workflow
through Codex and Lingo. S8 extends that baseline with one bounded parent
Execution whose validated DAG coordinates child Executions across at least two
operator-authorized Runtime paths. Sequential Executions remain valid one-node
graphs and retain their existing identities and history. GitHub Issues remains
the first Work Item Provider adapter. A
Project MAY remain portable-valid without a configured Work Item Provider, but
the supported Work Item journey MUST stop with an actionable missing-capability
result until a supported Provider is explicitly configured.

The supported detailed Execution gates remain:

```text
intake -> specification -> clarification -> plan -> tasks
-> implementation -> review -> evidence -> reconciliation -> completion
```

Clarification MAY be satisfied without a separate artifact when no material
question exists, but its gate result remains observable. Completion requires
all applicable technical gates plus explicit authority for any external
mutation. The Work Item lifecycle projection defined by the Issue #94 amendment
does not replace or advance these gates. Final MVP acceptance remains a separate
human decision.

## User journeys

### J1 — Clean installation and first run

From a clean supported environment, the developer follows published instructions,
installs a traceable Axiom build, discovers `lingo`, installs/verifies the Codex
integration, and receives first-run guidance into explicit Project setup. No
repository CWD, shell-profile mutation, existing maintainer state, or undocumented
credential setup is assumed.

### J2 — Intentional Project setup

The developer starts setup with complete arguments or a guided interview. Axiom
collects Project name/slug, Repository associations, machine-local working-copy
paths, and the Work Item Provider declaration needed by the intended workflow.
It shows portable intent separately from local bindings, validates a complete
proposal, and requires confirmation before publication.

### J3 — Intent-driven Work Item

The developer supplies an Intent. Axiom reuses supplied facts, asks only for
material missing information, and prepares a structured draft covering problem,
outcome, context, scope, constraints, non-goals, and acceptance expectations.
The complete draft is shown before any Provider mutation. Cancellation or denied
authority leaves Provider state unchanged.

### J4 — Visible workflow

The developer starts or resumes the bounded workflow. Local state records the
truthful current Execution gate and provider-neutral Work Item lifecycle stage.
With explicit Provider authority, the GitHub Issue shows exactly one canonical
Axiom lifecycle-stage marker, zero or more orthogonal auxiliary flags, and bounded
transition comments referencing relevant artifacts/Evidence. Failed, invalid,
skipped, contradictory, or interrupted transitions do not advance local truth or
project a later stage as complete.

### J5 — Argument-driven Runtime invocation

A fully specified Runtime invocation supplies Project, Repository, and Work Item
selectors directly and completes without an avoidable question. A partial
invocation asks only for missing or ambiguous values. Unknown or conflicting
arguments produce validation failure rather than silent fallback.

### J6 — Concise completion and details

Every relevant CLI or Runtime operation ends with the same semantic completion
result. The primary summary is short and scannable. When diagnostics, context,
or Evidence exceed that summary, Axiom materializes a Markdown detail artifact
and returns a stable reference to it.

### J7 — Failure, recovery, and retry

The developer can distinguish invalid input, denied authority, interrupted or
partial work, retryable external failure, incompatible state, and local storage
failure. Axiom preserves the last known authoritative state, reports confirmed
external effects, and provides the next safe action. Ambiguous recovery never
claims rollback or deletes unknown content.

### J8 — Supported upgrade

The developer inspects the installed version, follows the documented supported
upgrade path, previews any state migration and backup effects, authorizes mutation,
and verifies the resulting schemas and Runtime integration. Unsupported downgrade,
newer schema, or missing migration path fails before destructive mutation.

### J9 — Multi-runtime planned execution

Given one approved Plan and explicit operator configuration, the Agent Planner
proposes a bounded parent/child Execution Graph from required capabilities,
dependencies, scopes, authority and execution controls. The operator reviews material graph,
Runtime/Model Profile and authority decisions. Independent children run in
parallel only when their declared dependencies and repository-isolation rules
permit. Children coordinate through bounded structured questions, contracts,
blockers, artifact publications and results. A dedicated Integration/Reconciliation
Execution integrates isolated results, validates the combined state, and returns
truthful partial or terminal Evidence to the parent. Codex and Claude each execute
at least one independent child in the acceptance journey.

### J10 — Release-candidate acceptance

A reviewer executes the complete journey in an isolated clean environment using
an identified release candidate. The run exercises CLI and Runtime entrypoints,
Provider projection, output/provenance, representative failure/recovery, supported
upgrade, Evidence, and documentation. Automated success prepares but never makes
the final human acceptance decision.

## Functional requirements

### Project setup

- **FR-001 Explicit selection:** Project setup MUST NOT infer that CWD is the
  Project or Repository. Logical selectors and explicit paths are inputs, never
  ambient identity.
- **FR-002 Guided completeness:** setup MUST ask only for missing required or
  materially ambiguous inputs and MUST support non-interactive complete input.
- **FR-003 Portable/local separation:** Project identity, Repository keys, and
  Provider declarations belong to portable intent; absolute working-copy paths,
  credentials, observations, and executable locations remain machine-local.
  Consumers resolving the portable configuration of an installed Project use the
  configuration source recorded by that installation; they must not infer a
  different source from the Project slug (Specification 002 classifies the
  configuration source location as machine-local installation data).
- **FR-004 Review before publication:** Axiom MUST show a safe normalized summary
  of portable and local changes and require exact mutation authority before write.
- **FR-005 Multi-repository:** the flow MUST accept multiple independent
  Repository associations without common paths, Providers, or submodules.
- **FR-006 Provider capability:** the intended Work Item workflow MUST identify a
  supported Provider/capability explicitly. Unsupported Providers MUST remain
  explicit and MUST NOT be silently mapped to GitHub.
- **FR-007 Reexecution:** equivalent setup is deterministic and idempotent;
  conflicting identity, slug, source, binding, or state is explicit.

### Work Item capture

- **FR-008 Intent first:** Work Item creation MUST begin from supplied Intent,
  not require a prewritten Provider title/body.
- **FR-009 Bounded interview:** questions MUST be limited to missing information
  that changes the problem, outcome, context, scope, constraints, non-goals, or
  acceptance expectations.
- **FR-010 Structured draft:** Axiom-authored drafts MUST preserve those sections
  in a Provider-appropriate representation suitable as Specification input.
- **FR-011 Mutation gate:** Provider create/update MUST occur only after the
  complete draft is shown and explicit external-mutation authority is granted.
- **FR-012 Neutral application boundary:** Provider-specific formatting and
  transport remain adapters; the application behavior does not depend on GitHub.

### Workflow visibility

- **FR-013 Local truth:** validated local workflow state is the execution source
  of truth; Provider state is an authorized, idempotent, reconcilable projection.
- **FR-014 Current-stage marker:** the supported GitHub adapter MUST expose exactly
  one canonical current Axiom lifecycle-stage marker from the Issue #94 closed
  namespace. The domain value remains Provider-neutral.
- **FR-015 Transition comment:** a material transition comment MUST contain stage,
  outcome, relevant references, provenance, and next action when applicable.
- **FR-016 Truthful failure:** failed, denied, interrupted, or partial transitions
  MUST NOT present a later stage or external completion as successful.
- **FR-017 Reconciliation:** replay/reconciliation MUST avoid duplicate markers
  and semantically duplicate comments while preserving confirmed Provider effects.
- **FR-038 Durable Work Item anchor:** a managed Work Item MUST expose a bounded
  durable lifecycle projection that connects the current stage to stable
  Specification, Plan/Tasks, Pull Request, Evidence, blocker, and next-action
  references without copying dense artifacts.
- **FR-039 Lifecycle stage:** the closed provider-neutral
  `WorkItemLifecycleStage` MUST be derived deterministically from canonical
  Execution gate/history plus the explicit local facts defined by this amendment;
  it MUST NOT be independently persisted or transitioned. GitHub MUST map the
  derived value to the exact `axiom:stage:*` set and treat zero, multiple, unknown,
  or contradictory markers as projection drift (zero markers before the first
  established projection are bootstrap; see the 2026-09-29 reconciliation).
- **FR-040 Gate projection:** every canonical gate transition MUST retain S4's
  exact current gate/revision, prerequisite, reference, blocker, and authority
  checks. Lifecycle derivation from the resulting snapshot MUST either return the
  unique mapped stage or `recovery_required`; it MUST NOT mutate canonical truth.
- **FR-041 Auxiliary flags:** blocked, decision, approval, and recovery conditions
  MUST remain orthogonal to lifecycle stage. Provider markers MUST NOT create or
  clear local facts by themselves.
- **FR-042 Bounded history:** material lifecycle comments MUST be bounded,
  idempotent, provenance-marked, and reference-first; repeated reconciliation
  MUST NOT duplicate them.
- **FR-043 Missing-local-state reconciliation:** Provider projection/history,
  Repository artifacts, and available local records MAY produce a read-only
  reconciliation or exact recovery plan, but MUST NOT silently reconstruct an
  Execution or infer a transition. Contradictory or insufficient evidence MUST
  return `recovery_required` and require human decision.
- **FR-044 Project metadata policy:** Project configuration MUST be able to
  resolve required/default Work Item and Pull Request metadata through
  provider-neutral intentions and capability results. Provider-specific fields
  and effects remain adapter-owned; only unresolved mandatory values may prompt.

### Runtime invocation

- **FR-018 Known inputs:** supported Runtime skills MUST accept available Project,
  Repository, Work Item, and operation-specific inputs directly under the validated
  host invocation contract.
- **FR-019 Missing-only questions:** supplied valid values MUST be reused; only
  missing or ambiguous values may trigger questions.
- **FR-020 Strict arguments:** unknown, duplicated, or conflicting inputs MUST fail
  clearly. They MUST NOT be ignored or converted into ambient-CWD inference.
- **FR-021 Thin delegation:** parsing/adaptation MAY be Runtime-specific, but every
  validated selector and action MUST reach the same Lingo/application contract as
  the direct CLI path.

## Completion output contract

Every relevant completed CLI command and Runtime skill invocation MUST expose one
canonical semantic result. Human text, Runtime rendering, and structured JSON MAY
vary in syntax, but MUST NOT vary in meaning.

### Required result fields

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `status` | One canonical terminal status from the set below. |
| `result` | Short primary outcome, bounded to one scannable statement. |
| `references` | Relevant Project, Repository, Work Item, Execution, local operation-correlation, Provider, or artifact identifiers/links. Omit only when none exists. |
| `next` | Next safe action when further action is applicable. |
| `details` | Stable reference to a Markdown detail artifact when one exists. |
| `provenance` | Canonical Axiom product/version/build identity. |

Human output SHOULD fit in a compact block and MUST NOT emit large diagnostics,
raw logs, raw model reasoning, or full Evidence by default. Structured output MUST
use stable fields/categories rather than require prose parsing.

### Canonical terminal statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `success` | Requested operation completed with its promised effects confirmed. |
| `failure` | Non-validation, non-retryable operation failure; no later success is implied. |
| `validation_failure` | Input, state, schema, compatibility, or invariant failed before the requested valid transition completed. |
| `denied_authority` | Required authority was absent, refused, stale, or did not cover the exact effects. |
| `partial` | Some effects are confirmed and others did not complete; confirmed effects and remaining work are explicit. |
| `interrupted` | Execution stopped before a terminal operation result; persisted/externally confirmed state is reported without inferred rollback. |
| `retryable_failure` | A transient external or environmental dependency failed and a bounded retry is safe under the stated preconditions. |

An operation MUST NOT classify an unknown or ambiguous side effect as `success`.
`retryable_failure` MUST name the retry boundary and MUST NOT authorize duplicate
external mutation. Application contracts own the classification; skills and
Provider adapters only render it.

## Detailed Markdown artifact contract

A detail artifact MUST be created when information necessary for diagnosis,
review, Evidence, recovery, or continuation would exceed the concise summary;
when a retained failure matrix or validation report is required; or when a
workflow/release gate requires durable Evidence. The summary alone is sufficient
for routine success, expected no-op, simple validation failure, or denied authority
when all actionable facts fit in the primary contract.

Artifacts MUST:

- be Markdown, bounded in size, sanitized, and free of secrets/raw chat history;
- have stable identity independent of a display filename;
- record the applicable Execution reference or local operation-correlation
  identity, creation time, provenance, source references, outcome, and retention
  class;
- be referenced by the completion result and, when it supports a claim, by the
  corresponding Evidence record;
- distinguish diagnostic context from Evidence claims;
- remain machine-local unless an explicit later publication action is separately
  authorized;
- never enter the Portable Project Manifest or portable Project working copy by
  implementation convenience.

HD-2's durable architecture is recorded in
[ADR-0006](../../decisions/0006-machine-local-detail-artifacts.md): one central
Axiom-owned machine-local artifact boundary; stable opaque identity; Execution as
primary owner/correlation when present; a non-domain local correlation identity
before Execution; Evidence references rather than automatic Evidence status;
purpose-based retention; and explicit reference-aware, fail-closed cleanup.
Exact paths, layouts, packages, limits, and retention durations remain Plan work.

## Provenance contract

Axiom-authored textual content on every supported MVP surface MUST carry one
canonical informational provenance model:

| Field | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| product | Exact identity `Axiom`. |
| version | Release semantic version when built as a release; otherwise explicit `development`/unreleased identity. Never invent a release version. |
| revision | Short source revision when embedded or truthfully observable; otherwise explicit `unavailable`. |
| source state | `clean`, `dirty`, or `unknown`. Dirty MUST NOT be presented as the clean revision alone. |

Presentation MAY be a compact footer, header, subtitle, comment, or valid metadata,
depending on surface. CLI/Runtime summaries, Provider Issue/PR bodies and comments,
generated Markdown, and generated source/text files MUST expose equivalent facts
without breaking syntax or overwhelming the summary.

Provenance MUST be produced centrally and supplied to renderers/adapters. A skill,
template, or Provider adapter MUST NOT hardcode an independent version rule.
Transported user text remains user-authored. If Axiom wraps or transforms it, the
marker MUST distinguish Axiom-authored framing from unchanged user content and
MUST NOT claim authorship over the transported content.

## Persistence, recovery, compatibility, and migration

- **FR-022 Authoritative state:** publication MUST expose either the prior complete
  valid state or the new complete valid state, never a partial state as canonical.
- **FR-023 Commit truth:** pre-commit failure preserves prior authority; a confirmed
  post-commit effect is reported as committed even if later sync, local persistence,
  Provider projection, or cleanup fails.
- **FR-024 Filesystem confinement:** writes MUST remain within the exact authorized
  target, with traversal, symlink, hard-link, collision, and replacement protections
  appropriate to the approved threat model.
- **FR-025 Recovery:** recognized interrupted artifacts MUST fail closed with
  deterministic classification and guided recovery. Unknown artifacts MUST be
  preserved. Ambiguous state MUST require operator review and MUST NOT be repaired
  or deleted automatically.
- **FR-026 Schema compatibility:** every portable and local persisted format MUST
  have an explicit version, reader compatibility rule, and forward-transition
  classification. Ownership and schema compatibility are separate: state being
  Axiom-owned or positively recognized MUST NOT by itself imply that semantic
  migration is safe. Missing, malformed, unsupported-newer, unsupported-older and
  out-of-window versions are distinct failures. The current stable compatibility
  window contains only canonical persisted-state format v1. RecognizedPOC is a
  separately supported historical transition and does not expand that stable
  window. Any future stable release that introduces a new persisted-state format
  MUST declare, before publication, the exact earlier stable formats retained in
  its supported compatibility window and one supported forward path for each:
  direct compatibility, a bounded validated migration, or preserve plus
  rebuild/reconfiguration. State safely identified as historical RecognizedPOC
  follows the 2026-10-01 Issue #153 decision: preserve a verifiable historical
  copy, rebuild clean compatible active state, and reconfigure only explicitly
  supported information. Historical POC Execution/workflow truth MUST NOT
  silently become current canonical truth.
- **FR-027 Migration preview:** any mutating migration MUST validate source state,
  show source/target versions and affected roots, identify backup/rollback behavior,
  require exact authority, and revalidate the result.
- **FR-028 Backup and rollback:** migration MUST preserve a recoverable pre-migration
  copy before canonical replacement when rollback cannot otherwise be guaranteed.
  Backup identity, permissions, retention, and cleanup MUST be explicit.
- **FR-029 No silent downgrade:** downgrade or lossy conversion is refused unless a
  separately specified reversible path exists. Newer unknown state is never
  overwritten as if absent.
- **FR-030 Portable/local boundary:** migration MUST NOT move secrets, absolute
  paths, local observations, workflow state, or Execution artifacts into portable
  Project intent.

The residual POC gaps are not silently waived. ADR-0005 maps traversal, supported
link/replacement cases, process concurrency, deterministic injected fault stages,
logical old-or-new publication, permissions/ACL checks, fail-closed uncertainty,
and guided recovery into the supported boundary. Malicious same-UID arbitrary
interleavings, physical power loss, and physical-media durability are explicitly
unsupported guarantees, not solved risks. Compatibility and forward-transition Evidence remains governed by HD-4 plus the
2026-10-01 Issue #153 reconciliation: supported strategies are explicit, preserved
historical truth is not promoted, and unsafe/out-of-policy state remains fail-closed.

## Installation, onboarding, and upgrade

- **FR-031 Supported path:** one published, documented install path MUST work from
  a clean supported environment and yield an inspectable version/provenance result.
- **FR-032 Prerequisites:** missing tools, incompatible platform, invalid destination,
  and unavailable Runtime integration MUST fail with actionable next steps.
- **FR-033 Ownership:** installed binary, receipt, Runtime skills, portable Project
  data, local state, Evidence, and detail artifacts MUST be documented as separate
  ownership/lifecycle categories.
- **FR-034 Safe repetition:** reinstall and upgrade MUST be idempotent for equivalent
  owned content and refuse unowned/conflicting replacement.
- **FR-035 First run:** first-run guidance MUST lead to explicit Project setup and
  MUST NOT configure the CWD implicitly.
- **FR-036 Runtime compatibility:** Lingo and installed Runtime skills MUST expose
  a detectable compatibility result. An incompatible known skill set is upgraded
  only through the authorized install/upgrade flow.
- **FR-037 Upgrade ordering:** binary/Runtime integration and persisted-state
  compatibility checks MUST be ordered so a failed upgrade does not silently leave
  an unusable mixed state. Partial confirmed effects use the completion contract.

HD-1 selects checksummed macOS/Linux binaries plus source installation for
contributors. The exact supported OS/architecture combinations remain a required
Plan/release declaration before distribution.

## Agent Planning and Execution Graph

- **FR-045 Planner proposal:** the Agent Planner MUST derive a proposed topology
  from an approved Plan's outcomes, required capabilities, dependencies, risks and
  validation obligations. It MUST NOT assume fixed frontend/backend/QA/infra roles,
  grant authority, or start a child.
- **FR-046 Validated DAG:** an Execution Graph MUST be finite and acyclic, identify
  one parent and bounded child Executions, declare dependency satisfaction rules,
  and fail before execution on cycles, missing nodes, incompatible scopes, or
  unresolved required inputs.
- **FR-047 Identity and lineage:** every parent and child MUST have a stable opaque
  Execution identity. Each child MUST reference its parent and graph revision;
  parent completion MUST correlate every child attempt, result, artifact and
  Evidence reference without treating an Agent as Execution identity.
- **FR-048 Runtime/Model Profile resolution:** resolution MUST select only an
  installed, enabled and operator-allowlisted Runtime/Model Profile compatible
  with the requested role, capabilities and complexity. Role and Model remain
  independent, and concrete model names remain machine-local Model Profile data,
  never domain values. Absence of an allowed match MUST block; no implicit Runtime
  or model fallback is permitted.
- **FR-049 Capability contract:** each child MUST declare required capabilities
  independently from its resolved Runtime/Model Profile. Resolution observations
  MUST distinguish configured, installed, available and proven capability rather
  than inferring readiness from a declaration.
- **FR-050 Child scope and authority:** each child MUST receive an immutable bounded
  envelope containing inputs, outputs, Project/Repository target, workspace,
  allowed effects, authority references, dependencies, timeout and maximum
  attempts. A child MUST NOT widen its own scope, authority, dependencies, Runtime
  choice or execution controls.
- **FR-051 Isolation and concurrency:** dependency-ready children MAY run in
  parallel only when their effect sets and workspace strategy are compatible.
  Children that can mutate the same Repository MUST use isolated workspaces or
  worktrees; shared or conflicting mutation MUST serialize or block explicitly.
- **FR-052 Structured coordination:** cross-Runtime questions, answers, contract
  proposals/acceptance, blockers, dependency resolution, artifact publication,
  progress and results MUST be bounded, typed, correlated and Axiom-owned. Raw
  Runtime chat, unrestricted reasoning and untrusted child output MUST NOT become
  workflow truth, authority or Evidence.
- **FR-053 Integration/Reconciliation Execution:** graph delivery MUST include one
  bounded child responsible for validating declared child results, detecting
  conflict or drift, integrating only authorized isolated changes, running required
  combined validation, and publishing a result to the parent. Other children MUST
  NOT silently merge or publish into the delivery branch.
- **FR-054 Execution controls:** parent and child timeout plus maximum-attempt
  controls MUST be explicit before dispatch. Cancellation and retry MUST respect
  those controls; automatic attempt expansion is forbidden.
- **FR-055 Truthful usage/cost telemetry:** when a Runtime exposes reliable usage or
  cost data, the observation MUST retain source, unit and status. Missing data MUST
  be `unavailable`; partial data MUST remain `partial`. S8 MUST NOT estimate missing
  values, normalize cross-Runtime units or enforce token/cost budget governance.
- **FR-056 Cancellation:** cancellation MUST stop new dispatch, request bounded
  cancellation of affected active children, preserve already confirmed effects,
  and record children as not-started, cancelling, cancelled, completed or unknown
  without claiming rollback.
- **FR-057 Retry:** retry MUST require policy, remaining authority and an available
  attempt under the explicit maximum, create a new correlated attempt, preserve
  prior attempts and confirmed effects, and refuse ambiguous external-effect replay
  until reconciliation.
- **FR-058 Partial outcomes:** blocked, failed, cancelled, skipped, unknown and
  successful child outcomes MUST roll up deterministically. Parent success requires
  all required dependencies plus successful Integration/Reconciliation; optional
  or waived outcomes require an explicit human decision where they change scope.
- **FR-059 Evidence and provenance:** each child MUST retain graph/parent identity,
  role, capability request, resolved Runtime/Model Profile, runtime/model version
  when observable, configuration reference, scope/authority/execution controls, attempts,
  usage/cost observation, result, artifacts and validations. Parent Evidence MUST
  summarize and reference these records without embedding raw chat or secrets.
- **FR-060 Sequential compatibility:** existing ADR-0008 Executions MUST remain
  readable/resumable with unchanged meaning. They are treated as compatible
  sequential executions, not silently rewritten into new child identities or
  attributed to an Agent/Model.
- **FR-061 Human gates:** operator review MUST remain explicit for material graph or
  scope changes, Runtime/Model allowlist changes, stale authority, attempt-limit changes,
  destructive/external effects, conflict resolution, acceptance and S8
  implementation authorization. Automated planning or green validation cannot
  satisfy those decisions.

### S9 productization requirements

- **FR-062 Public CLI identity:** the canonical installed product entrypoint MUST
  be `axiom`. Public documentation and acceptance journeys MUST use `axiom`.
  Internal Lingo packages/concepts MAY remain, but the installed contract MUST NOT
  depend on a user-created shell alias as the primary `axiom` entrypoint.
- **FR-063 Automated release artifacts:** one clean revision MUST produce the
  supported native release artifacts, closed manifest/checksum metadata and exact
  version/revision provenance through repeatable automation. Artifact preparation
  MUST remain separate from authority to publish a prerelease/release.
- **FR-064 Stable remote installation:** supported macOS/Linux users MUST be able
  to install from one stable remote bootstrap command without cloning the
  repository or building from source. The canonical versioned bootstrap source
  MUST be `scripts/install.sh` in this repository, consumed through the
  repository's stable raw URL. The bootstrap MUST detect the supported
  OS/architecture, resolve one published release under the release-selection
  policy below, select the matching published artifact, verify integrity before
  installation and install only into an owned safe destination.
  Release-selection and version policy (Issue #81):
  - published versions use SemVer-compatible tags: stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
    (published with `prerelease=false`) and release candidate
    `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc.N` (published with `prerelease=true`); draft releases
    are never installable;
  - with no selector, and with the explicitly equivalent `--channel stable`, the
    bootstrap installs the latest published stable release. It MUST NOT silently
    fall back to a release candidate; when no stable release exists it fails
    explicitly with zero installation effects and directs the operator to
    `--version <tag>`;
  - `--version <tag>` resolves exactly that published stable or RC tag and never
    floats to a newer release. A release candidate is selected only by its exact
    tag, `--version vX.Y.Z-rc.N`;
  - a floating release-candidate selector (for example a newest-RC channel) is
    not an S9 product requirement. Any selector the bootstrap does not support
    fails as an input error with zero installation effects;
  - `--channel` and `--version` are mutually exclusive; supplying both is an
    input error with zero installation effects, and neither selector silently
    wins;
  - selectors are resolution policy only: once resolution succeeds, the
    installation and its Evidence are bound to the exact resolved release
    identity (tag/version, source revision where published metadata exposes it,
    selected asset, asset SHA-256, platform/architecture and installation
    receipt), not to the selector.
- **FR-065 Convergent reinstall/upgrade:** rerunning the supported bootstrap MUST
  converge through the existing ownership/preview/recovery safety contracts. For
  an installation Axiom owns and recognizes, ownership and persisted-state
  compatibility are evaluated independently. The same resolved version is an
  idempotent no-op. A newer resolved version MUST first resolve one explicit
  supported forward-transition strategy for the observed state: direct, bounded
  migration, preserve plus rebuild/reconfiguration, or refuse. Historical
  RecognizedPOC uses the approved preserve -> clean rebuild -> supported
  reconfiguration path and MUST NOT promote historical Execution/workflow truth
  into current canonical state. An older resolved version is refused as an
  automatic downgrade with zero installation effects. Foreign, modified, unsafe,
  ambiguous, corrupt, unsupported-newer, or out-of-window persisted state MUST
  fail closed and MUST NOT be overwritten to satisfy any version or channel
  selection. Stable releases MUST keep the supported persisted-state compatibility
  window explicit and must provide a forward path for every earlier stable format
  that remains inside that window.
- **FR-066 Multi-runtime first run:** `axiom first-run` MUST inspect supported
  Runtimes already present on the machine and configure every supported detected
  Axiom integration. Runtime skills/integration files installed by Axiom MUST use
  that Runtime's user-global scope, never a Project-local scope as the product
  default or fallback. For the MVP this includes Codex user-global skills in
  Codex's global skill root and Claude user-global skills at
  `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or ~/.claude>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. MVP acceptance MUST
  cover Codex-only, Claude-only, Codex+Claude and no-Runtime cases. First run MUST
  NOT silently install a Runtime, provision/mutate Runtime credentials, provision
  secrets, purchase subscriptions/capacity or invent availability.
- **FR-067 Self-hosted acceptance path:** after S8, S9 acceptance MUST include
  real Axiom engineering/delivery work coordinated through Axiom itself, using the
  approved parent/child Execution Graph, Codex and Claude Runtime paths,
  Integration/Reconciliation and structured Evidence rather than treating the
  Runtimes as unrelated direct-prompt development surfaces.

### S8/S9 security requirements

- Credentials remain Runtime/Integration-owned machine-local references. A parent
  or child receives only the minimum credential capability needed for its effects;
  secrets are never copied through prompts, coordination state, artifacts or
  Evidence merely to share them across Runtimes.
- Command execution uses explicit argument vectors, bounded environment and working
  directory, timeout/cancellation, captured-output limits and exact child authority;
  no child content may introduce shell interpolation, hooks or undeclared tools.
- Repository/worktree selection is validated against the child envelope before
  process start and before integration. Unsafe paths, links, ownership, foreign
  changes, stale bases or cross-worktree targets fail closed.
- Planner, Runtime and child outputs are untrusted data. Prompt/content injection
  cannot amend the graph, authority, allowlist, execution controls, dependency state or human
  gates. Structured schemas, provenance and deterministic validation precede use.
- Coordination retention is bounded and reference-aware. It excludes raw chat and
  hidden reasoning, sanitizes published fields, and preserves required audit facts
  until parent/Evidence retention permits safe cleanup.
- Cancellation revokes future dispatch authority but does not erase confirmed
  effects. Stale authority, concurrent mutation, unresolved workspace ownership or
  ambiguous cancellation/retry state requires reconciliation before more effects.
- Runtime/model fallback, child authority escalation, child-created children and
  timeout/attempt expansion are denied unless a new explicit operator decision
  grants the exact changed envelope.
- Axiom-owned Runtime skills are confined to the current user's Runtime-native
  global skill/configuration root. Project-local Runtime skill installation is
  not a fallback for missing or unsafe global state.

## Failure cases and invariants

The MVP MUST handle at least:

- absent, invalid, ambiguous, or conflicting Project/Repository/Work Item selector;
- unsupported Provider or missing Work Item capability;
- incomplete interview, cancellation, and denied mutation authority;
- invalid/duplicate Runtime arguments;
- Provider unavailable, unauthenticated, rate-limited, invalid response, or
  confirmed mutation followed by local failure;
- failed, interrupted, resumed, stale, or already-completed workflow transition;
- inconsistent lifecycle derivation, unmet canonical gate prerequisite, or absent human decision;
- zero, multiple, unknown, manually changed, or contradictory Provider stage
  markers and auxiliary flags;
- unresolved required Work Item/Pull Request metadata policy;
- missing local Execution with aligned, insufficient, or contradictory
  Provider/Repository recovery signals;
- completion summary rendering failure after confirmed domain/external effect;
- detail-artifact write failure without hiding the primary operation truth;
- released, development, dirty, and revision-unavailable provenance;
- missing/corrupt/newer/older persisted schema;
- interrupted publication or migration, insufficient space, permission denial,
  collision, unsafe links, concurrent writer, and recovery-required state;
- incompatible binary/Runtime skill versions and partial upgrade;
- unsupported installer platform/architecture, checksum mismatch, unavailable
  artifact, foreign/modified install target, unsafe owned state or ambiguous
  bootstrap/upgrade result;
- no published stable release for the default selector, unpublished requested
  tag, conflicting `--channel`/`--version` selectors, unsupported selector, or an
  older resolved version that would require an automatic downgrade;
- Codex-only, Claude-only, Codex+Claude and no-supported-Runtime first-run state,
  including partial Runtime integration configuration that must remain truthful;
- invalid/cyclic graph, unresolved dependency, incompatible child scope, or stale
  graph revision;
- no operator-allowed Runtime/Model Profile satisfying required capabilities;
- unavailable Runtime, timeout, malformed/untrusted child output, or missing usage
  data;
- child authority/execution-control escalation, automatic Runtime fallback, or undeclared
  command/tool request;
- worktree collision, stale base, foreign concurrent mutation, integration conflict,
  or combined validation failure;
- cancellation or retry with confirmed, ambiguous, or partially published effects;
- required child blocked/failed/cancelled/unknown while siblings have succeeded.

Global invariants:

1. CWD never supplies Project or Repository identity implicitly.
2. Portable intent never contains secrets or machine-local state.
3. A valid Project does not imply operational workflow readiness.
4. No external mutation occurs without exact authority and review where required.
5. CLI and Runtime skills share application semantics, terminal statuses, and
   provenance; presentation differences do not create parallel contracts.
6. Provider projection cannot advance local workflow truth.
7. Confirmed effects survive truthful reporting; failure never invents rollback.
8. Evidence is inspectable support for a claim, not raw chat history.
9. Axiom provenance never claims authorship over unchanged user content.
10. Automated validation never grants final human acceptance.
11. A valid Execution snapshot derives exactly one lifecycle stage; no second
    lifecycle state is persisted and auxiliary conditions never create synthetic
    stage combinations.
12. `accepted` exists only after an explicit human decision; merge, CI, PR review,
    Issue closure, and Provider status never imply it.
13. Missing local workflow truth is inspected and recovered explicitly, never
    reconstructed or advanced from Provider projection.
14. Execution identity and lineage never collapse into Agent, Role, Runtime or
    Model identity; `Execution != Agent` and `Role != Model` remain exact.
15. A child cannot expand its own scope, authority, effect set, dependencies,
    Runtime/Model selection or execution controls.
16. Dependency readiness and non-conflicting isolated effects are prerequisites
    for parallel dispatch; completion order never substitutes for declared edges.
17. Parent success requires the declared required children and successful bounded
    Integration/Reconciliation; partial work is never summarized as full success.
18. Raw chat and untrusted Runtime output are neither coordination authority nor
    Evidence. Structured state and retained references remain canonical.
19. No Runtime/model fallback, attempt-limit expansion, child spawning or credential
    sharing occurs implicitly.

## Non-functional requirements

- output and diagnostics MUST be deterministic for equivalent input/state, except
  for explicitly identified time/identity fields;
- secrets and rejected sensitive values MUST not enter output, logs, artifacts,
  Evidence, Provider comments, or migration backups;
- user-facing summaries MUST remain bounded and scannable;
- file reads/writes and captured external output MUST be bounded;
- local state and generated artifacts MUST use restrictive platform-appropriate
  permissions and reject unsafe ownership/link conditions;
- supported operations MUST be reproducible without maintainer-local state;
- observability MUST correlate one operation across summary, artifact, Evidence,
  local state, and Provider projection without exposing credentials; under
  ADR-0006, artifacts are subordinate to Execution when one exists, while a
  pre-Execution command uses only an opaque non-domain local correlation identity.
- graph scheduling and roll-up MUST be deterministic for the same validated graph,
  observations and child outcomes; wall-clock completion order MUST NOT alter truth;
- coordination, per-child output and usage records MUST be bounded and resumable;
- cancellation and timeout responsiveness MUST be observable per child without
  converting an unknown Runtime stop into confirmed cancellation;
- any Runtime-provided token/cost telemetry MUST preserve units, sources and
  unavailable data rather than fabricate cross-Runtime equivalence; S8 defines no
  token/cost budget enforcement.

## Observable acceptance criteria

| ID | Observable acceptance |
|---|---|
| AC-01 | Clean installation yields discoverable `lingo`, truthful provenance, and verified Codex integration using only published instructions. |
| AC-02 | First run enters explicit Project setup without treating CWD as Project/Repository. |
| AC-03 | Guided and fully argument-driven setup produce equivalent validated Project/application behavior. |
| AC-04 | Multi-repository portable intent and local absolute bindings remain separate; review precedes publication. |
| AC-05 | An unsupported/missing Work Item Provider capability blocks the workflow explicitly without silently selecting GitHub. |
| AC-06 | Intent-only Work Item creation asks bounded missing questions, presents a structured draft, and mutates GitHub only after authority. |
| AC-07 | Supplied Work Item fields are reused; cancellation and denied authority leave Provider state unchanged. |
| AC-08 | Provider state shows exactly one current workflow-stage marker and idempotent bounded transition comments. |
| AC-09 | Failed/interrupted/resumed workflows remain truthful locally and on the Provider; no later stage is projected early. |
| AC-10 | Fully specified skill invocation needs no selector round trip; partial invocation asks only for missing/ambiguous values. |
| AC-11 | Invalid/conflicting skill arguments fail predictably and never fall back to CWD. |
| AC-12 | Representative CLI and Runtime operations produce semantically equivalent `success`, `failure`, `validation_failure`, `denied_authority`, `partial`, `interrupted`, and `retryable_failure` results. |
| AC-13 | Routine outcomes use only the short summary; oversized diagnosis/Evidence creates one referenced Markdown artifact under the approved ownership/lifecycle contract. |
| AC-14 | Detail artifacts are sanitized, bounded, identity-addressable, correlated, and never silently portable. |
| AC-15 | CLI, Runtime, Provider comments, Markdown, and generated source/text expose equivalent truthful provenance for release, development, dirty, and unavailable-revision builds. |
| AC-16 | Unchanged transported user content is not labeled as Axiom-authored. |
| AC-17 | Supported publication faults preserve old/new complete authority, classify recovery deterministically, and preserve unknown artifacts. |
| AC-18 | Unsupported schema/version combinations fail before destructive mutation. Historical RecognizedPOC state is positively identified, completely preserved before retirement, rebuilt into clean compatible active state, and reconfigured only from validated supported intent; historical POC Execution/workflow truth remains inspectable historical material and is not promoted into current canonical truth. |
| AC-19 | Reinstall/upgrade is safe and idempotent for owned equivalent content and refuses unowned conflicts. |
| AC-20 | A representative confirmed Provider effect followed by local failure reports `partial` with the confirmed reference and a safe next action. |
| AC-21 | Clean-environment RC dogfood completes install -> first run -> Project -> Work Item -> workflow -> Evidence -> completion through Runtime and direct CLI entrypoints. |
| AC-22 | RC dogfood exercises validation, authority denial, interruption/resume, retryable external failure, recovery-required state, and supported upgrade. |
| AC-23 | Versioned Evidence identifies candidate build, environment, commands, exits, hashes/references, exclusions, and known limitations without raw chat history or secrets. |
| AC-24 | Human explicitly accepts or rejects the Specification and, later, the release candidate; automation never fills either decision. |
| AC-25 | Every valid canonical Execution gate/history plus required-fact combination derives exactly one of the ten Work Item lifecycle stages; GitHub projects it as the exact namespaced label defined by this amendment. |
| AC-26 | Canonical gate transition behavior remains S4-compatible; lifecycle derivation is read-only, and missing/contradictory non-boundary facts return `recovery_required` with zero local or Provider effects. |
| AC-27 | A managed GitHub Issue converges to exactly one lifecycle-stage label plus the applicable independent auxiliary flags without removing foreign content. |
| AC-28 | Material lifecycle history comments remain bounded, reference-first, provenance-marked, and idempotent across replay. |
| AC-29 | Merge, green CI, PR approval, Issue closure, or manual Provider metadata cannot produce `accepted`; only terminal canonical completion plus one explicit revisioned human decision can. |
| AC-30 | With local workflow state unavailable, inspection returns either an exact authorized local-generation recovery plan or `recovery_required`; no Execution or transition is silently synthesized. |
| AC-31 | Project policy deterministically resolves available Work Item/PR metadata, prompts only for unresolved mandatory values, and keeps GitHub-specific fields inside the adapter. |
| AC-32 | One approved Plan yields a finite reviewable DAG whose child roles/capabilities, scopes, dependencies, authority, outputs and execution controls derive from work rather than a fixed role template. |
| AC-33 | Cycles, unresolved dependencies, overlapping unsafe effects, stale graph revisions and child self-escalation fail before unauthorized dispatch or mutation. |
| AC-34 | Runtime/Model Profile resolution selects only installed, available, capable and operator-allowlisted choices; no match blocks and no implicit fallback occurs. |
| AC-35 | At least two dependency-independent children execute concurrently in isolated workspaces, while dependent or conflicting work remains blocked/serialized. |
| AC-36 | Codex and Claude each execute at least one independent child in one real authorized acceptance graph with per-child Runtime/Model Profile/configuration provenance. |
| AC-37 | Children exchange at least one bounded structured question/answer or contract and publish correlated artifacts/results without raw chat becoming workflow truth or Evidence. |
| AC-38 | Integration/Reconciliation detects drift/conflict, integrates only authorized child results, runs combined validation, and alone may produce the integrated delivery result. |
| AC-39 | Parent and child timeout/maximum-attempt controls are enforced; any reliable Runtime-provided usage/cost remains observational with source/unit/status, and missing data is explicitly `unavailable`. |
| AC-40 | Cancellation stops new dispatch and reports each child truthfully; retry creates a correlated attempt and never duplicates an ambiguous external effect. |
| AC-41 | Required child failure, blocker, cancellation or unknown result produces deterministic partial/non-success parent truth while preserving successful sibling results and confirmed effects. |
| AC-42 | Parent Evidence traces graph revision, lineage, authority, execution controls, coordination, artifacts, validations, child attempts/results and observed usage without secrets, unrestricted reasoning or raw chat. |
| AC-43 | Existing sequential Executions remain readable/resumable with unchanged identity and semantics after graph support is introduced. |
| AC-44 | A clean supported environment installs a checksum-verified published Axiom binary without source checkout/build and invokes it through the canonical `axiom` executable. Selection follows FR-064: no selector or `--channel stable` resolves only the latest published stable release and never an RC; `--version <tag>` resolves exactly that tag; a missing stable release, conflicting selectors or an unsupported selector fail with zero installation effects; the installation records the exact resolved release identity. |
| AC-45 | The release automation produces the complete supported native artifact/checksum/provenance set from one clean revision without implying publication authority. |
| AC-46 | Re-running the stable remote installer is a no-op when the owned installation already has the resolved version. A newer owned installation resolves an explicit supported state transition before upgrade; supported stable formats inside the compatibility window converge, and RecognizedPOC converges through preserve -> clean rebuild -> supported reconfiguration. Older-version downgrade and foreign/modified/unsafe/ambiguous/corrupt/unsupported-newer/out-of-window state are refused with no silent overwrite. |
| AC-47 | `axiom first-run` configures all supported Runtimes detected on the machine and truthfully covers Codex-only, Claude-only, Codex+Claude and no-Runtime cases without installing Runtimes or mutating credentials. |
| AC-48 | The exact RC clean-environment journey uses the public `axiom` CLI and remote installer on every supported release row before Project/workflow/runtime acceptance, pinning the same immutable candidate with `--version vX.Y.Z-rc.N` and never a floating selector. |
| AC-49 | At least one real Axiom engineering activity in S9 is coordinated through Axiom with Codex and Claude child Executions, Integration/Reconciliation and inspectable parent/child Evidence. |

## Required acceptance Evidence

Release-candidate Evidence MUST include:

- exact Axiom version, source revision/state, platform, architecture, Runtime and
  Provider adapter versions;
- clean-environment construction and prerequisite inventory;
- installation and upgrade commands with exit statuses and installed checksums;
- stable remote-installer identity plus platform-selection, download, checksum,
  owned-target, reinstall/no-op, owned-upgrade, downgrade refusal and
  foreign/unsafe refusal Evidence;
- release-selection Evidence showing the selector used and the exact resolved
  release identity (tag, source revision where published, asset, asset SHA-256,
  platform/architecture, receipt), plus stable-only default, missing-stable,
  selector-conflict and unsupported-selector refusals;
- public CLI identity proving the installed executable is invoked as `axiom`
  without a required user-created alias;
- release-automation Evidence binding one clean revision to all supported native
  artifacts, manifests/checksums and version/revision provenance without implying
  publication authority;
- first-run Runtime discovery/bootstrap matrix for Codex-only, Claude-only,
  Codex+Claude and no-Runtime states, including zero credential/subscription/
  Runtime-install effects;
- CLI/Runtime semantic-equivalence matrix for every terminal status;
- Project portable/local separation and multi-repository observations;
- Work Item draft/authority and Provider projection references;
- workflow gate transitions, interruption/resume, artifact identities/digests,
  and final completion reference;
- Work Item gate/fact-to-lifecycle derivation and flag matrix, exactly-one-stage Provider observations,
  bounded-history replay, missing-local-state reconciliation, and metadata-policy
  resolution/non-prompt observations;
- Agent Planner input and normalized graph proposal, validation result and graph
  revision, including cycle/overlap/stale-authority denials with zero effects;
- operator allowlist/configuration references and per-child capability request,
  resolved Runtime/Model Profile, availability observation, scope, authority,
  workspace, timeout and maximum attempts without credential values;
- scheduler dependency/parallelism trace proving at least two independent children
  ran concurrently, plus serialization of dependent/conflicting children;
- bounded structured coordination, child artifact/result publication and the
  Integration/Reconciliation result with combined validation;
- cancellation, timeout, retry, partial/unknown roll-up, confirmed-effect and
  no-implicit-fallback observations;
- per-child usage/cost telemetry when reliably exposed, retaining
  source/unit/status and recording missing values as `unavailable`; no estimation,
  cross-Runtime normalization or token/cost enforcement;
- one real authorized acceptance graph in which Codex and Claude each execute at
  least one independent child;
- one S9 dogfood activity in which Axiom engineering work is coordinated through
  Axiom itself and produces integrated parent/child Evidence;
- sequential ADR-0008 compatibility observations;
- provenance observations on each supported generated surface;
- filesystem fault/recovery and compatibility-transition matrix tied to the
  approved threat model, including migration Evidence only when migration is part
  of the approved path;
- secret/sensitive-file and security review results;
- relevant unit, integration, functional black-box, race, vet, build, module,
  repository, and documentation validation results;
- known limitations, unexecuted checks, and explicit human acceptance/rejection.

At least one acceptance run MUST use an isolated environment without existing
Axiom state. Controlled fakes MAY prove deterministic external failures, but the
supported Provider/Runtime journey requires a bounded real integration observation
before final acceptance. Every external mutation remains explicitly authorized.

## Delivery dependencies

```text

                       +--> #68 clean RC dogfood + docs + human acceptance
```

If authorized after the human decisions and required reconciliations, a future
Plan may reorder independently implementable units but MUST preserve
contract dependencies: provenance and completion semantics precede surface-wide
adoption; artifact ownership precedes persistence; migration policy precedes
upgrade; all delivered blocks precede #68. Approval of this Specification permits
the next expressly authorized phase only and does not itself authorize Plan work,
any delivery issue, implementation, or release.

The Issue #94 amendment adds one bounded Slice after delivered S5 and before the
current recovery/upgrade Slice. Its lifecycle/gate/projection/recovery-signal and
metadata-policy contracts must be delivered before compatibility hardening and RC
acceptance can claim the amended Work Item journey. Existing S4/S5 Tasks and
Evidence remain unchanged historical delivery records.

Issue #97 adds S8 after delivered S7. The former release-candidate S8 becomes S9.
T23–T25 keep their IDs and historical release-candidate objective; T24/T25 are
reconciled and expanded to validate and close Evidence for the new S8 product state.
The S8 graph behavior, ADR-0009, amended Plan and Tasks were explicitly approved on
2026-09-26. T30–T36 implementation was explicitly authorized on 2026-09-27 through
Issue #97 comment #5852650410. That authority covers implementation only.
The real T36 Runtime run later received separate exact authority, was executed,
and produced the recorded T36 Evidence. Validation, commit or merge do not infer
human acceptance or authorize S9, release, deploy or Provider mutation.

Issue #81 records the 2026-09-27 S9 product-scope expansion. Before T23 may
identify/publish an RC, S9 must provide the canonical public `axiom` executable,
automated supported-platform release artifacts, a stable verified remote
installer with idempotent reinstall/safe owned upgrade, and multi-runtime first
run for Codex and Claude. The existing T23–T25 IDs remain historical RC work; new
productization Tasks are appended for traceability. This recorded scope decision
does not itself authorize implementation or publication.

Later S9 human decisions are reconciled into FR-064–FR-066: the canonical
bootstrap source is `scripts/install.sh` consumed through the repository's stable
raw URL, and Axiom Runtime skills are user-global for every supported Runtime
(PR #104 review, 2026-09-27); the release-selection and version policy follows
Issue #81, with release candidates selected only by exact
`--version vX.Y.Z-rc.N` and no floating RC selector required (human decision,
2026-09-28).

## Requirements, details, and open questions

| Classification | This Specification |
|---|---|
| Requirement | Observable journeys, FR/AC contracts, failure states, invariants, Evidence, and preserved boundaries above, including FR-038–FR-061/AC-25–AC-43 from the approved S8 amendment and the 2026-09-27 S9 product-scope direction FR-062–FR-067/AC-44–AC-49 proposed for canonical amendment approval. |
| Implementation detail deferred to Plan | CLI framework, concrete Go packages/interfaces, exact JSON schema, prompt UI, filesystem syscalls, migration algorithm, installer implementation, artifact filename rendering, lifecycle/graph-record encoding, scheduler mechanism, concrete Runtime adapters, concrete model names and metadata-policy schema. GitHub label spelling is fixed only for the Issue #94 adapter projection. |
| Human decisions recorded | HD-1 through HD-4 and complete original Specification approval were recorded on 2026-09-20. ADR-0005/0006 directly formalize HD-3/HD-2. The Issue #94 amendment, FR-038–FR-044, AC-25–AC-31, S6 placement, and Specification 002 policy-reference clarification were explicitly approved on 2026-09-24. On 2026-09-26 human review approved FR-045–FR-061, AC-32–AC-43, ADR-0009, the amended Plan/Tasks, Codex plus Claude as concrete S8 acceptance paths, observational-only usage/cost telemetry, and the local T36 authority boundary. Implementation was separately gated at that time; S8/T30–T36 implementation was authorized on 2026-09-27 (Issue #97 comment #5852650410). The real T36 Runtime run later received its own exact authority, was executed, and produced `real_run_recorded` Evidence. The technical outcome is S8 ready for human review; human acceptance and S9 remain separate. On 2026-09-27 the human also recorded the S9 product direction: public `axiom` CLI, automated native release artifacts, stable idempotent remote install/owned upgrade, Codex+Claude first-run bootstrap and self-hosted Axiom dogfooding. The canonical S9 Plan/Tasks amendment remains subject to review before implementation. The PR #104 review on 2026-09-27 fixed the bootstrap source at `scripts/install.sh` and made Axiom Runtime skills user-global (Claude under `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or ~/.claude>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`). Issue #81 records the release-selection and version policy; on 2026-09-28 the human narrowed release-candidate selection to exact `--version vX.Y.Z-rc.N` pins without a required floating RC selector. |

## Human decisions recorded — 2026-09-20

These decisions were explicitly recorded during human review of PR #69. They
resolve the material directions needed by this Specification but do not by
themselves approve the complete Specification or authorize Plan, Tasks,
implementation, accepted ADRs, or release work.

### HD-1 — Supported release installation and platforms

**Decision:** use published checksummed binaries for macOS/Linux, while retaining
source installation for contributors.

The authorized Plan and release contract MUST explicitly declare the supported
OS/architecture combinations before distribution. Candidate combinations include
`darwin/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `linux/amd64`, and `linux/arm64`; this
decision does not silently promise every candidate. Any combination not explicitly
declared is unsupported for that release.

Package-manager distribution, automatic updating, Windows support, signing, and
notarization remain outside the MVP unless separately decided.

### HD-2 — Detailed artifact ownership and lifecycle

**Decision:** detail artifacts are durable, machine-local artifacts retained while
needed by workflow/Evidence and removed only through explicit safe cleanup. They
MUST NOT enter the Portable Project Manifest or portable Project working copy.

This decision intentionally does not create an `operation-attempt` entity parallel
to Execution. Before implementation, an ADR MUST define final ownership/location,
Evidence relation, retention and cleanup, and decide whether attempt identity is
subordinate to Execution or whether pre-Execution commands use only non-domain
local correlation identity.

### HD-3 — MVP filesystem threat model

**Decision:** adopt the bounded local threat model.

The supported boundary retains:

- confinement to the exact authorized target;
- traversal and supported symlink/link protections;
- process concurrency protection;
- deterministic injected fault stages;
- fail-closed uncertainty;
- guided recovery;
- protection against partial or invalid canonical state.

The MVP explicitly excludes guarantees against malicious same-UID actors performing
arbitrary interleavings and against physical power loss/media durability. These are
unsupported guarantees, not solved risks.

Because this narrows previously approved proof expectations, Specification 002 and
all affected security/architecture contracts MUST be reconciled before any Plan for
Specification 004 is authorized. The reconciliation/ADR MUST state supported and
excluded threats, still-mandatory properties, required Evidence, and the exact
relationship to Specification 002 SEC-003/SEC-005.

### HD-4 — Compatibility baseline and historical POC state

**Decision:** clean v1 installation is the officially supported compatibility
baseline.

`v0.1.0-poc.1` remains a historical snapshot without an automatic compatibility
or migration commitment. When POC-owned state is recognized, v1 MUST NOT treat it
as absent or overwrite it. The supported path provides actionable diagnostics and
preserves backup/export where applicable, followed by explicit export/reconfigure.

In-place migration from the POC remains unsupported unless a later bounded
compatibility/ADR decision proves it safe and explicitly authorizes it. Unknown
newer formats fail closed; unsupported older formats are diagnosed explicitly; no
migration or downgrade is silent; no generic N-1 or arbitrary historical
compatibility is promised.

**Issue #153 reconciliation — 2026-10-01:** HD-4 remains the historical
baseline and its prohibition on implicit in-place POC migration remains in force.
The later explicit human decision authorizes the canonical installer to automate
the previously manual preservation/reconfiguration journey for positively
recognized POC state as **preserve -> clean rebuild -> supported
reconfiguration**. This is not an authorization to convert POC workflow or
Execution history into current canonical truth. The same decision establishes an
explicit supported compatibility window for stable persisted-state formats:
stable formats inside the window require a supported forward path; recognizable
state outside that policy may still fail closed.
## ADR status and remaining candidates

- **Accepted from HD-2:**
  [ADR-0006](../../decisions/0006-machine-local-detail-artifacts.md) defines
  machine-local ownership, Execution-first/pre-Execution correlation, Evidence
  relation, retention, uncertainty, and safe cleanup without creating an
  operation-attempt domain entity.
- **Accepted from HD-3:**
  [ADR-0005](../../decisions/0005-bounded-local-filesystem-threat-model.md) defines
  the supported and excluded threats, mandatory persistence/recovery properties,
  and Specification 002 SEC-003/SEC-005 proof boundary.
- **Required before any in-place POC migration:** specific persisted-schema
  compatibility and migration/rollback decision; clean install plus
  export/reconfigure does not itself accept such migration.
- **Assess during an authorized Plan under HD-1:** distribution/supply-chain ADR
  if published binaries establish a durable release topology or trust boundary. A
  routine source installer alone does not justify an ADR.

ADR-0005 and ADR-0006 introduce no material choice beyond approved HD-3 and HD-2.
Other candidate decisions remain unaccepted.

### Issue #153 ADR assessment

No new ADR is required for this bounded reconciliation because it preserves the
existing source-of-truth, ownership, Execution identity, local publication and
recovery architecture. It changes the supported product compatibility policy and
installer orchestration contract, not the meaning of historical POC state.
ADR-0005 and ADR-0007 continue to govern filesystem safety, exact authority,
partial truth and recovery.

Stop and reassess an ADR before implementation if the solution instead requires
in-place semantic migration of POC workflow/Execution state, a generic migration
registry that becomes a new cross-cutting architectural authority, a new durable
compatibility store, or different source-of-truth/ownership semantics.
### Issue #94 ADR assessment

No new ADR is proposed. The amendment keeps the existing durable decisions:

- ADR-0003 keeps executable workflow behavior in Lingo under Axiom contracts;
- ADR-0004 keeps Project policy portable and local workflow observations/state
  machine-local;
- ADR-0007 remains the local commit/recovery authority;
- ADR-0008 remains the single stable Execution lineage and explicitly forbids
  reconstruction from Provider metadata.

The derived lifecycle projection, flags, bounded Provider history, recovery
inspection, and metadata-policy capability extend the approved Specification 004
contract without changing source-of-truth ownership, Execution identity/gate
semantics, Provider abstraction ownership, or fundamental recovery semantics.
ADR-0008 therefore remains valid without alteration: no second lifecycle field,
transition history, identity, or authority is introduced. Stop and reassess an ADR
if implementation instead requires a second workflow authority, portable/shared
Execution state, Provider-owned gates, a generic metadata/custom-field schema, or
silent reconstruction of local truth.

### Issue #97 ADR assessment

[ADR-0009](../../decisions/0009-parent-child-execution-graph.md) is accepted because
parent/child identity, DAG dependency semantics, authority inheritance, retry and
cancellation truth, integration ownership, structured coordination and
cross-Runtime Evidence are durable cross-cutting choices. ADR-0008 remains the
accepted historical basis for S4–S7 and existing sequential records. ADR-0009
evolves new graph executions while preserving sequential compatibility; this
Specification does not rewrite ADR-0008. Acceptance of the ADR does not authorize
S8 implementation.

## Constitution check

- Intent, actors, constraints, non-goals, failures, acceptance, and Evidence
  precede implementation.
- POC facts remain Evidence; experimental implementation does not silently define
  MVP contracts.
- Material architecture, security, compatibility, and ownership choices are
  recorded as explicit human decisions; required reconciliation and ADR gates
  remain enforceable.
- Deterministic classifications and stable references take precedence over prose
  or model judgment.
- Least privilege, exact mutation authority, portable/local separation, and
  honest partial outcomes are normative.
- Project remains distinct from Repository and runtime/provider products remain
  outside the domain core.
- Final acceptance remains human and separate from validation or merge.

## Review gate

HD-1 through HD-4 are recorded and the complete Specification was explicitly
approved by the human reviewer on 2026-09-20. The authorized reconciliation
produces ADR-0005/0006 and aligns Specification 002 plus affected architecture
contracts. Merge and human approval of that reconciliation remain the gate before
Plan. No Plan, Tasks, implementation, migration, installer, or release is
authorized by these documentation changes.

**Next artifact after merge and human approval of this reconciliation: Plan for Specification 004**

### Issue #94 amendment approval — 2026-09-24

The original review record above remains historical. Human review explicitly
approved FR-038–FR-044, AC-25–AC-31, the S6 delivery placement, and the
Specification 002 policy-reference clarification on 2026-09-24. This satisfies the
amendment decision gate. Merge, checks, Issue labels, or closure did not substitute
for that decision. T26–T29 implementation and successor Slice work remain
separately gated and are not started by this approval or merge.

### Issue #97 S8 amendment approval — 2026-09-26

Issue #97 records the human product-scope decision to add S8 before release-candidate
acceptance. Human review on 2026-09-26 explicitly approved FR-045–FR-061,
AC-32–AC-43, ADR-0009, the amended Plan/Tasks, Codex plus Claude as the concrete S8
acceptance Runtime paths, observational-only usage/cost telemetry, and the local
T36 authority boundary. T23–T25 retain their IDs and historical RC objective;
T24/T25 are expanded to validate and reconcile the product state added by S8.
This approval does not authorize S8 implementation, Runtime execution, external
mutation, release publication or final acceptance.

**S8/T30–T36 implementation authorized on 2026-09-27 (Issue #97 comment
#5852650410). The real T36 Runtime run later received its own exact authority,
was executed, and produced the recorded Evidence. Technical outcome: S8 ready
for human review. Human acceptance remains pending.**

The concrete T36 activity may be selected during preparation, but it MUST be a
small real Axiom engineering change and satisfy AC-32–AC-43. Model Profile values
remain local configuration, with no concrete model names in the domain. T30–T36
implementation is authorized by its exact authority (Issue #97 comment
#5852650410). The later T36 real run was separately authorized and executed;
that execution does not authorize human acceptance, S9/T23–T25, merge, release,
deploy or Provider mutation.

### Issue #153 compatibility decision — 2026-10-01

The human explicitly approved the compatibility direction on 2026-10-01:

- automate RecognizedPOC through preserve -> clean rebuild -> supported
  reconfiguration;
- do not promote historical POC Execution/workflow truth into current canonical
  state;
- set the current supported stable persisted-state compatibility window to
  canonical v1 only; RecognizedPOC remains a separately supported historical
  transition;
- require every future stable release that introduces a new persisted-state format
  to declare before publication the exact earlier stable formats retained in its
  compatibility window and the supported forward strategy for each.

This decision authorizes Specification/Plan/Tasks reconciliation only. It does
not authorize implementation, migration effects, release publication, merge, or
Issue closure. The reconciled Plan/Tasks remain reviewable artifacts before
implementation authority is granted.
