# Specifications

Specifications define desired outcomes and observable behavior before implementation
plans. Approval gates remain separate: an approved Specification permits planning;
implementation requires an approved Plan/Tasks and explicit authorization for the
bounded delivery unit. Technical merge does not imply human acceptance or next-Task authority.

## 001 — Codex agent harness generation

[Specification](001-codex-agent-harness-generation/spec.md): **Proposed**.

## 002 — Lingo Project Initialization

First active vertical slice, in incremental implementation. Current lifecycle,
reconciled on 2026-09-18 against versioned artifacts, merged PRs and POC issues:

| Artifact / delivery | Status |
|---|---|
| [Specification](002-lingo-project-initialization/spec.md) | **Approved** |
| [Plan](002-lingo-project-initialization/plan.md) | **Approved** |
| [Tasks](002-lingo-project-initialization/tasks.md) | **Approved** |
| T01–T03 | **Accepted / merged** — PRs [#6](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/pull/6), [#7](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/pull/8) |
| T04 | **Merged; pending human acceptance/re-review** — [PR #9](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/pull/9); not marked Accepted |
| POC #16–#18 | **Merged in [PR #27](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/pull/27)** — executable CLI, minimal init/validate/reopen/name update and separate local install |
| POC #19 | **Closed / historical Evidence** — bounded hardening delivered; HD-3/ADR-0005 retain supported fault/concurrency/confinement proof while classifying physical power loss and arbitrary malicious same-UID interleavings as unsupported guarantees |
| POC #20 | **Closed / not planned for further POC work** — deterministic/E2E Evidence was sufficient for POC acceptance; broader Evidence requirements move to the future MVP scope |
| POC #21 | **Accepted / closed** — E2E dogfooding and limitations reconciled on 2026-09-20 |
| Specification 002 / POC #14 | **Partial implementation; not Accepted/Done** |

PR #27 merged the initial POC baseline; PR #28 merged bounded hardening. Current verification and dogfooding
Evidence, including the residual limitations accepted for POC closure, are recorded in
[POC Evidence](002-lingo-project-initialization/evidence-poc.md). The POC issue
deliveries do not establish completion of the full T05–T21 Task DAG.

PR #9 received a final human re-review on 2026-09-17 reporting no findings and
“Ready to merge”, then merged. That review is recorded; it is not converted here
into an explicit Task Accepted decision. T04 acceptance remains a human lifecycle
gate. Neither its merge nor this documentation reconciliation authorizes T05.

Specification approval originated on 2026-09-11. Subsequent
[Clarifications](002-lingo-project-initialization/clarifications.md) preserve Q1–Q6
and H1–H13 history. H13, derived from Specification 004 HD-3 on 2026-09-20,
reconciles SEC-003/SEC-005 and affected AC/Plan/Task Evidence with the bounded local
filesystem threat model in
[ADR-0005](../decisions/0005-bounded-local-filesystem-threat-model.md). It preserves
confinement, supported link/replacement protection, process concurrency, fault
injection, complete canonical state and recovery while explicitly excluding
malicious same-UID arbitrary interleavings and physical power-loss/media guarantees.
Plan and Tasks approval followed in PRs
[#4](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/pull/4) and [#5](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/pull/5).
Dated pre-merge gates in those artifacts and Evidence describe their review-time
state; use this index for the current consolidated lifecycle.

Issue #94's cross-Specification clarification was explicitly approved on
2026-09-24: Work Item metadata policy reuses the existing `schemaVersion: 1`
`policies` document references without adding manifest fields or migration. The
separately versioned policy-document contract is now part of the approved amendment
and does not change the delivered Specification 002 manifest baseline.

Implementation Evidence:
[T01](002-lingo-project-initialization/evidence-t01.md),
[T02](002-lingo-project-initialization/evidence-t02.md),
[T03](002-lingo-project-initialization/evidence-t03.md),
[T04](002-lingo-project-initialization/evidence-t04.md).
T01–T04 established Project domain rules, application contracts and portable/local
codecs. POC #16–#18 delivered the initial CLI, filesystem persistence and local
installation. Specification 003 adds bounded Codex Runtime, GitHub Work Item and
sequential workflow adapters without completing the remaining Specification 002
Task DAG. #19/#20 were closed after POC acceptance without claiming their stronger
proof obligations were satisfied; those residual concerns are inputs to MVP
hardening. #21 was accepted/closed during the 2026-09-20 E2E POC acceptance.
This does not mark Specification 002 or parent #14 complete.

## 003 — E2E Codex POC

Implementation-authorized on 2026-09-19 and tracked by #30–#40.

| Artifact | Status |
|---|---|
| [Specification](003-e2e-codex-poc/spec.md) | **Approved** |
| [Clarifications](003-e2e-codex-poc/clarifications.md) | **Resolved** |
| [Plan](003-e2e-codex-poc/plan.md) | **Approved** |
| [Tasks](003-e2e-codex-poc/tasks.md) | **Approved / authorized** |
| T31–T40 Evidence / reconciliation | **Delivered / merged to `main` in PR #52** |
| [Final report](003-e2e-codex-poc/final-report.md) | **ACCEPTED — 2026-09-20** |

The requested standalone skill spelling `axiom:<skill>` is incompatible with the
validated Codex hyphen-case skill-name contract. The authorized reversible POC
mapping is `$axiom-<skill>`. #30/#40 were explicitly accepted and closed on
2026-09-20 after PR #52 merged to `main`.

Acceptance testing created MVP follow-ups
[#54](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/54),
[#55](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/55),
[#56](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/56) and
[#57](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/57). They record guided setup,
Intent-driven Work Item creation, provider-visible workflow progress and
argument-driven Runtime skill UX; they do not retroactively expand POC scope.

## 004 — Usable MVP v1 Baseline

[Specification](004-mvp-v1-baseline/spec.md): **Approved — human approval recorded on 2026-09-20**.

Issue [#94](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/94) defines the amendment for
a durable Work Item lifecycle anchor and metadata governance. Human review on
2026-09-24 explicitly approved FR-038–FR-044, AC-25–AC-31, T26–T29/S6 placement,
and the Specification 002 policy-reference clarification. S6 implementation remains
separately gated.

[Plan](004-mvp-v1-baseline/plan.md): **Approved — human approval recorded on
2026-09-20** together with ADR-0007 and ADR-0008.

[Tasks](004-mvp-v1-baseline/tasks.md): **Approved — human approval recorded on
2026-09-20 in [PR #72](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/pull/72)**. The corrected
original final DAG has 25 vertical delivery units across S1–S7 and is reconciled
with the approved Plan. T01–T25 remain the approved historical decomposition.
The approved #94 amendment adds T26–T29 after S5 and renumbers the remaining
Slices to S7/S8. The amended DAG has 29 Tasks across S1–S8; T01–T25 remain the
historical decomposition and T26–T29 are the approved S6 additions. S1 is tracked in
[#75](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/75): T01 canonical
completion/provenance was accepted and merged in PR #74, and T02–T03 were
delivered through PR #83. S2 was delivered through PR #84 and is tracked in
[#76](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/76). S3 was explicitly authorized
on 2026-09-22 and is tracked in
[#77](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/77); T08 and T09 were delivered
through PR #85 and their deterministic tests are recorded in
[S3 Evidence](004-mvp-v1-baseline/evidence-s3.md). T09's separately authorized
bounded real-provider observation created Issue #90 and is complete. Human
acceptance is not inferred. S4 was delivered through PR #91. S5 was explicitly
authorized on 2026-09-23 and delivered through PR #93;
T14–T15 implementation, deterministic tests, and bounded real Codex Runtime
observation are recorded in
[S5 Evidence](004-mvp-v1-baseline/evidence-s5.md). Human acceptance is not
inferred. S6 and remaining S7–S8 implementation remain separately gated.

Issue [#62](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/issues/62) originally authorized
Specification and reconciliation only. After PR #70 resolved that gate, the
Plan was explicitly requested and authorized as process context for PR #71 only;
no separate GitHub authorization artifact was cited. PR #71 is the auditable
approval point, and neither the request nor checks/merge imply approval. The approved
Specification consolidates #54–#57 and #63–#68 into the clean-environment journey
from installation through explicit human acceptance.
It defines Project/Work Item UX, Provider workflow projection, Runtime selectors,
completion statuses, detailed Markdown artifacts, provenance, persistence,
compatibility, onboarding, acceptance criteria, and required Evidence.

Human review on 2026-09-20 recorded HD-1 through HD-4: checksummed macOS/Linux
binary distribution with an explicit release OS/architecture matrix, durable
machine-local detail artifacts with an ADR-required Execution/correlation
boundary, the bounded filesystem threat model with mandatory Specification
002/security/architecture reconciliation before Plan, and clean v1 as the
compatibility baseline without automatic POC migration. The complete Specification
was explicitly approved on 2026-09-20. HD-3 is formalized by
[ADR-0005](../decisions/0005-bounded-local-filesystem-threat-model.md) and the
dated Specification 002 H13 reconciliation; HD-2 is formalized by
[ADR-0006](../decisions/0006-machine-local-detail-artifacts.md) without adding an
operation-attempt domain entity. PR #70 merged that reconciliation to `main` and
received explicit human approval, resolving the Plan gate. Plan review identified
two new durable decisions:
[ADR-0007](../decisions/0007-local-publication-and-recovery-protocol.md) for the
shared local publication/recovery protocol and
[ADR-0008](../decisions/0008-minimal-machine-local-execution-record.md) for the
bounded sequential Execution record. Both were **Accepted by explicit human
decision on 2026-09-20**, and the Specification 004 Plan was Approved in the same
PR #71 decision. The corrected final 25-Task DAG was then **Approved by explicit
human decision in [PR #72](https://github.com/rgomids/axiom/pull/72) on
2026-09-20**, concluding the Tasks phase. On 2026-09-21 T01 was explicitly
accepted and merged in PR #74 and operational governance moved to the Slice
boundary. T02–T03 were delivered to `main` through PR #83; their reproducible
security/filesystem record is in
[S1 Evidence](004-mvp-v1-baseline/evidence-s1.md). S2 was then explicitly
authorized and T04–T07 were delivered through PR #84 with the reproducible record
in [S2 Evidence](004-mvp-v1-baseline/evidence-s2.md). S3 was explicitly authorized
on 2026-09-22; T08–T09 implementation and deterministic tests are recorded in
[S3 Evidence](004-mvp-v1-baseline/evidence-s3.md). T09's mandatory bounded
real-provider observation is complete at its documented historical revision.
Technical completion and current review corrections remain separate from human
acceptance. S4 was delivered through PR #91. S5 was explicitly authorized on
2026-09-23 and its T14–T15 technical record is in
[S5 Evidence](004-mvp-v1-baseline/evidence-s5.md). S6 and remaining S7–S8,
Provider mutation outside an exact authorized run, prerelease/release publication,
and final MVP acceptance remain separately gated. Accepted operational Slice
trackers are #75–#79 for S1–S5, #94 for S6, #80 for S7, and #81 for S8 after the
2026-09-24 amendment reconciliation.
