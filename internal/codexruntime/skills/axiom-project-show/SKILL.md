# Show Axiom Project

Collect a Project slug or ID when absent. Run `lingo --json project show
--selector <slug-or-id>` and report its structured Project and repository
associations. Never infer a repository from Codex's current working directory.
Preserve the supplied selector exactly, ask only when it is absent or Lingo
reports it ambiguous, and never resolve identity independently.

Canonical completion fields: `status`, `result`, `references`, `next`, `details`, `provenance`
Operation-specific payloads preserved separately: `project`

Copy canonical completion fields only from Lingo's top-level JSON object. Omit
canonical fields absent from that object. Never derive, synthesize, or reinterpret
a canonical field from `project` or another operation-specific payload. When
Lingo returns `project`, preserve and report that payload separately according to
its original semantics, including its repositories and relevant associations.
Never reinterpret `project` as `details` or another canonical field.
